It is a powerful depiction of the last 12 hours of Jesus' life, thanks in part to its director, the brilliant Mel Gibson, who directed and starred as Justin Mcleod in \"The Man Without A Face\" and William Wallace in \"Braveheart\", the latter, which won him the Best Director Oscar. He also well known as Dr. Gibbon in \"The Singing Detective\" (2003), Graham Hess in \"Signs\" (2002), Lt. Col. Hal Moore in \"We Were Soldiers\" (2002), Nick Marshall in \"What Women Want\" (2000), Benjamin Martin in \"The Patriot\" (2000), Porter in \"Payback\" (1999), Martin Riggs in the Lethal Weapon movies (1987, 1989, 1992, 1998), Jerry Fletcher in \"Conspiracy Theory\" (1997), Tom Mullen in \"Ransom\" (1996), the voices of Rocky and John Smith in \"Chicken Run\" (2000) and \"Pocahontas\" (1995), Bret Maverick in \"Maverick\" (1994), Capt. Daniel McCormick in \"Forever Young\" (1992), Hamlet in \"Hamlet\" (1990), Mad Max Rockatansky in the Mad Max movies (1979, 1981, 1985, 2005 or 2006), and Fletcher Christian in \"The Bounty\" (1984). His directing in this movie is brilliant without compromise. Everything he did to make this movie has paid off brilliantly. The cast including Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Jesus' mother, are brilliant as well. Caviezel's performance as Jesus, is emotionally powerful and brilliant and as the co-anchor of the movie, besides, Gibson, does a brilliant job as much as Gibson did. Gibson's production company, Icon Productions, has produced movies of his such as, \"The Singing Detective\" (2003), \"Payback\" (1999), \"What Women Want\" (2000), \"Braveheart\" (1995), \"We Were Soldiers\" (2002), \"Fairy Tale: A True Story\" (1997), \"Forever Young\" (1992), \"Hamlet\" (1990), \"The Man Without A Face\" (1993), and \"Maverick\" (1994). The screenplay by Benedict Fitzgerald and Gibson is brilliant. The music by John Debney is brilliant. The cinematography by Caleb Deschanel is brilliant. The film editing by John Wright is brilliant. The production design by Francesco Frigeri and the costume design by Maurizio Millenotti is brilliant. The casting by Shaila Rubin is brilliant. The set direction by Carlo Gervasi is brilliant. The visual and make-up effects by Greg Cannom and Keith Vanderlaan is brilliant. This movie make a powerful point about how Jesus died and the point is brilliant and succeeds on every level. The language, which is in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew, which is shown in English subtitles, proves that you don't need to speak English to have a brilliant film with heart and soul. Go see this movie now or if you can see it. This is an achievement on every level. It is a movie to remember forever.\n",

            "The Passion of the Christ, the very controversial Mel Gibson religious epic has been highly anticipated and now released.  I had the priviledge of seeing last night and was not disappointed, but I should point out that this is the kind of film which you can't \"like\" or \"dislike.\"  The film stays true or mostly true to the Gospel it's based upon.  The film tells of the last 12 hours of Christ's life.  The depicitions of the crucifixition are quite graphic and very intense, this film is not recommended to be viewed by children.  Though I should also add that it is not the most violent or bloody film that has been made or that I have seen.Caleb Deschanel's cinematography is outstanding and should definetly be nominated for an Academy Award next year along with John Debney's engrossing music score.  James Caviezel does a great job portraying Jesus of Nazareth along with Monica Bellucini and others.  Mel Gibson is very capable as a director as he is an actor, he certainly proved that to us with the glorious epic, Braveheart.  I must say that this film is not anti-semetic in its views, and it certainly should be viewed as a telling of the Gospel.  Gibson simply made a movie about the last 12 hours of Jesus's life, he's not making any accusations.The film which opened on Ash Wednesday (2/25/04) has already grossed an outstanding $117.6 over the 5 day period along with $76.2 million over the weekend.  It certainly has proved to be a success and of blockbuster caliber, the film's budget was only about $25 million which Mel Gibson put in, in other words he used his own money to make the film.  This is the second-highest grossing \"R\" rated film after The Matrix Reloaded.  Of course you shouldn't see this movie for its success at the box-office, if you're very religious and want to experience a movie which should be experienced by everyone, then see The Passion of the Christ.The Passion of the Christ is rated R for Sequences of Graphic Violence.  The violence as stated earlier is intense and brutal.  During the crucifixtion, the nails are hammered into Jesus's hands and feet in slow motion, Jesus's body is drenched with blood.  There's also an extended scene of Jesus being savagely punished at the hands of malicious Roman soldiers.  Though the film's violence might derive you from seeing this film, you should definetly experience especially at the movie theatre.  You must see it to believe it, see The Passion of the Christ\n",

            "I never was a religious person. But nevertheless I have to say that \"The Passion of the Christ\" is something. I can't recall when a movie had such an impact on me. It is simply astounding. Much because of not used nowdays latin and arameic and much more thanks to brilliant and superior (I could give countless epithets) actors, you don't have a feeling of watching a film. You don't have a feeling of watching a documentary. You have a definite feeling that you ARE there. And that happens (to me at least) not often. One of the main effects of the film is that the story-line is well known. You know from the very beginning how it is going to end. So it's interesting and almost unbearable to see how wrong choices were made and how after a chain of decisions dictated either by ignorance or by cowardice or by both the most innocent person ever on our planet was exposed to terrible torture and suffering and then put to death. We see how Judas repents after his betrayal but there's no way back. We see how Pontius Pilate (shown here as a good-natured man) hesitates but then sends Jesus to Golgotha (he might also repent but it's too late). We see all these people and we pity them for they really knew not what they were doing. During the whole film I had this desire to tell them: wake up, don't make this mistake, don't you see you are doing evil? I think all the time - what if everything had happened the other way? But apparently there were no other way because Jesus had predicted everything that'd happen.The movie is really shocking and appalling, and not because of violence and gore. It's the ultimate tragedy of mankind and it is just intolerable to watch it.\"The Passion of the Christ\" has one of the best casts I've ever seen in cinema. Jim Caviezel really effuses light, guess he was the perfect candidate for this part. Maia Morgenstern (Maria), Hristo Shopov (Pontius Pilate) and especially Rosalinda Celentano (Satan) look like they were born for these roles. I'm utterly impressed and dazed.If you easily get appalled by screen violence I can say this: try to withstand these two hours, it's the way to feel at least the relish of sufferings Jesus had to withstand.Whether you are a religious person or not watch this film, it's thought-provoking and serious-minded.And as of an alleged antisemitism of which the film was accused many times... well, I haven't noticed any. Don't believe all that fuss.\n",

            "The best art has a backstory of sacrifice and hardship and Mel Gibson's work of art, The Passion of the Christ has such a backstory.  In 2003, Passion producer Mel Gibson, was accused of every sort of malice from the Hollywood elite that is hostile to this movie, Christianity, and Western Civilization in general.The movie is the story of the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ and it is filmed in a color tone that reminds the viewer of a Renaissance painting of the same subject.  It is also unique in that the dialogue is spoken in Latin and Aramaic, the languages of the time.  Greek is left out although it was the lingua franca of the Eastern Roman Empire.The movie make a point to emphasize the various smaller Saints that were part of the story.  For example, Pontius Pilatus' wife, an Orthodox Saint, is favorably featured.  An Ethiopian servant is also shown as receptive to the message of Christ.The movie is graphic, torture and blood is featured, however the affair is artfully done.  Violence, after all is a major part of art.Most movies pushed from Hollywood is nothing more than \"dreck,\" but this work is high art melding the classic works of da Vinci, Albrecht D&uuml;rer, Rembrandt, and Michelangelo with the modern medium of cinema.  This movie should be shown on Network TV every Good Friday.\n",

            "A very brutal and terrifyingly emotional piece, &quot;American History X&quot; takes many cult and gang issues and packs it all into a gorgeous film. Edward Norton stars as Derek Vinyard, a man who has been in jail for  three years for murdering two black men. Upon his return to his family's  new apartment, the viewers learn of Derek's past involvement with the  largely-populated white supremacist gang in California. It is also made  clear that he wishes to escape his past life, to break free from the gang  that considers him to be &quot;a god.&quot; As he begins meeting his old  friends again, he discovers that his younger brother has become involved in  the gang, and throughout the movie, black-and-white flashbacks are used as  Derek's thoughts and stories used in order to convince his brother to leave  the gang before he gets himself in too deep. The film is totally violent  and utterly graphic, leaving none of the brutal aspects of the gang's  nature to the imagination. Norton and Edward Furlong, who plays the  brother, give excellent performances that add nothing but integrity and  believability to the film. While being graphic in nature, the film is a  breathtaking view of what life is like in gangs and cults, and the  life-long consequences that accompany them.\n",

The film itself is crystal clear, the sound (and score) are magnificent, and the bonus features included in this package alone are worth the price of admission.  The making-of documentary, Fearful Symmetry, is particularly well done.TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD chronicles a small town rocked by a racially-charged court case as seen through the eyes of an innocent young girl.  This movie is superbly written and acted, there doesn't appear to be a wasted frame in the entire running time.  The story here (much like its source material) is heartwarming, heartbreaking, tear-jerking, and laugh-out-loud funny.  This movie has received a lot of attention and hype over its year, and it is all well-earned.  I'm glad to say that this film has stood the test of time.If you have not seen TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD before, this is definitely worth a purchase.  If you have seen this movie before, but outside of this 50th Anniversary Edition, it's still worth a buy for the fantastic quality and bonus features.\n",

The picture quality of this new digital transfer is downright stunning and easily surpasses all previous DVD releases.

To take but that example, the studied close-up shots of Ingrid Bergman's face are simply breathtaking. The sound is mastered perhaps a little low, but with the volume turned up sufficiently, proves clear and flawless.The extras alone would already be worth the investment. There are two interesting, complementary commentaries by film historian Rudy Behlmer and critic Roger Ebert. Especially Ebert's narration will learn you a lot about what you actually see on the screen. (Watch for the midgets around the plane in the closing scene). There is a fine documentary on Humphrey Bogart presented by Lauren Bacall and on disc 2 Stephen, son of Humphrey Bogart and Pia Lindstr&ouml;m, daughter of Ingrid Bergman evoke how their parents experienced Casablanca. In \"You Must Remember This: A Tribute to Casablanca\" one gets a complete view of the production.

Predator was expected to be a big hit before it was even released, while Robocop became a suprise hit at the box office. In addition, Robocop's fame transcended move theaters, and soon Robocop served as the inspiration for toy action figures, an arcade game, a Nintendo Entertainment System game, and a pinball machine.The original Robocop is easily one of the top science fiction films of the 1980s. The DVD edition, unfortunately, does not live up to all it could. The only extras are three trailers. It would have been nice to see some footage on the creation of Robocop's well done special effects, such as the designing and creation of ED-209. Also, the DVD transfer does not have the greatest picture quality. The picture quality seems more along the lines of VHS than DVD.Nevertheless, Robocop succeeds in large part due to its adrenaline-pumping action and shoot outs. Robocop's haunting memories of the life of a murdered Detroit police officer, Murphy, add some nice humanity and drama to the intense action. I love the Robocop theme music, which plays whenever the cyborg is crusing the streets of Detroit in his patrol car.\n",

            "Well, my friends, you may have heard the news.George Lucas and 2oth Century Fox are re-releasing the Star Wars trilogy on DVD.No, it's not the ORIGINAL CLASSIC TRILOGY THAT WE ALL LONG FOR.I sincerely wish it was, as those are the movies that made me fall in love with Star Wars to begin with (Well, not literally in love, but you get the point).No, apparently Lucas' ego cant come to grips with releasing the movies that made his hiney famous to begin with (The ORIGINAL Movies, untouched by Lucas' sometimes irritating \"tweaking\".)No, this set is the same exact set that was released last year  (The \"Special Editions\"), only, they have new packaging, and the 4th bonus disc that was included with last year's DVD set is NOT included with this set!That's correct, Lucas and Fox want you to spend over $30 for a set that is WITHOUT the 4th Bonus disc that the last set had.I.E., Lucas wants you to fork over $30+ dollars for a NEW BOX.That's it. New packaging. The packing looks much like the packing for the last set, only the metallic Silver/black, and Gold/black have been changed to the colors of the original Star Wars movie poster.You can see the new packaging, by going to [...]Is it worth over $30?That's up to YOU.But one question remains....WHY?Why re-release the SAME EXACT MOVIES, when the shelves of stores all across the world are still stocked with the original packaging?Why take the 4th bonus disc OUT of this set?Why charge people over $30 just for a new box, but with the same darn movies?Why not just release the ORIGINALS instead of releasing the same darn \"special edition\" Trilogy twice in Two years?It is easier to understand Jar Jar Binks, than it is to answer the questions asked above.But if you use the force, the answer will come to you.Yes, come to you it will.That answer?????M O N E YYes, the answer is money.Lucas and Fox have chosen to steal 30 MORE dollars from their fans, by redecorating the box that the same movies as last years release came in, in hopes that you'll fork over more money.Yes, Grinches, Lucas and Fox are, yes, yes!They could have given Star Wars fans the ULTIMATE Christmas DVD gift- The original movies, restored, remastered, for us to finally own and enjoy and for us to relive many fond memories with.But, those classic movies are not being released on DVD anytime in the near future. In fact, Lucas says that he will not EVER release them.When the rumored \"Ultimate\" Star Wars Saga 6 DVD set is released, we may be able to see some deleted scenes from the original trilogy....the ones that Lucas removed 20 years later.We MAY have that to look forward to. But then again, this comes from a man who says that he cares about the people who made him a billionaire, yet robs them of the movies that they DO want, and repackages the movies that they already have, so that they will buy the darn things a year later.Thus the reason why the 4th disc has been removed....it makes the set sell for only $30 dollars rather than close to $50.I.E, Lucas and Fox want to hypnotize as many fans as possible, into buying this cheaper set, for the Holiday rush. Is it a coincidence that the DVD's are being released December 6th?Not September 6th. Not January 6th. No, these DVD's are being re-released right square between Thanksgiving and Christmas, when shoppers will be most busy. They waited until Star wars fans would go to the store and buy Volume 2 of the cool \"Clone wars\" Cartoon, and they wanted to make us impulsively buy the movies that we impulsively bought two extra copies of a year ago.They are looking for \"spur of the moment\" dollars.If they cared for their fans, they would have made this CHEAPER set available to us last year, but then they would have lost that extra $20 dollars, and they couldnt allow that.No, they waited til they bled consumers dry on the last set, before they threw the DVD's in a new box and made them available in THIS set. Without the bonus disc of course.I am mad about this. Granted, there ARE more important things going on in the Universe than a damn DVD set.But this is an insult to Star Wars fans. Star Wars movies have always been about values, honor and integrity.It is a shame that the maker and distributors of these films do not hold the same values, honor and integrity. They have become money whores like any other businessmen.They are as greedy as Boba Fett negotiating on what a valued bounty should be worth to him. It's all about money. Star Wars is a business to George Lucas. That is why he hasnt had a problem re-doing many of the original movie scenes. To him, its just a job.To him, these are just movies.The force is NOT strong in George Lucas.If it was, he wouldn't throw these EXACT movies as last year's DVD release in our faces and ask for over $30.If the force was truly with Lucas, he would have done what Spielberg did with E.T.-Released the original AND Special Editions of the movies, so that his vision and his fans memories could BOTH be fulfilled.Mr Lucas, you have much to learn, my old Padawan.The dark side is greed. Consume you it has.Forgotten who made your dreams come true you have.Otherwise you would have made our dreams come true, and given us the movies that we have been dreaming of. Not the same movies in a new box.Grateful that is not.Ok, no more Yoda talk.Mr Lucas, you are wrong for re-releasing these movies on DVD.You just want people like me..... die-hard Star Wars fans to fork over 30 MORE dollars into your Billionaire account.And we will. And I probably will too. I'll see the new packaging, and say \"No, this guy only wants money....you HAVE these movies already, Matt... walk away......but..... there IS new packaging......and the price is LOWER without the bonus disc...., well why not\", and our urge to relive those Star wars memories will take us over and overshadow the reality that we are buying the movies because they appear different. You know that, and you let it occur anyway. You use our very love of the movies that made you who you are, and you use it to bleed even more and more money out of us.Palpatine would have been proud.\n",

They altered a few things from the last DVD set release. For example, they changed Boba Fett's voice to the same one as Django Fett, they made Vader yell \"nooo\" at the end of Return of the jedi, and they added some visual details that were not present from before. Overall the changes add more positives than negatives, and it just depends on what the particular person likes and doesn't. I thought they were fair changes to keep things looking fresh, and to help keep things compatible with the prequel trilogy. For those that don't like the changes, I think Disney will release the movies in original unaltered formats someday. These films never get old for me, and they are a treasure to have in the best format possible.\n",

            "One of the MOST anticipated Blu Ray release of all time is finally here.  We've all seen it numerous times and every media outlet imaginable has either quoted it or used it as a hook for our attention.  Why does it get our attention?  Because it is one of those films that has an in depth fantastic world with clear defined lines of good and evil, backed with a powerful plot filled with likable and detestable characters.  Most of all it's so much fun to watch, because no matter what age you are it brings the kid inside of you alive.Alive is what you will feel when viewing these Blu Rays.  These Blu Rays are by far the most impressive I have ever seen of an older movie restored, many times unbelievable was the word that came to mind.  Picture quality on all three films is crisp and clear, the best they have ever looked and then some.  The light sabres glow with intensity, Darth Vaders helmet shines with mirror like blackness and certain scene details come to life for the first time.  Several times I found myself looking at the characters detailed surroundings instead of the character themselves.  The picture quality on all three films has been so thoroughly examined there are not any moments where you wish they could have done more in any particular scene.  The picture quality is simply amazing and your eyes will be glued to the screen with the dynamic DTS HD Master Audio mix that draws you in with its dynamic use of the sound field.The picture quality is amazing, but the DTS HD Master Audio soundtrack is in one word AWESOME. If ever you wanted to be immersed into the Star Wars universe this soundtrack will leave you awestruck. Star Destroyers rumble the scene as they pass over, Tie fighters scream from the rears to the fronts as they fly over and fight scenes come alive like an actual war is taking place in your media room.  AT-ATs, Speeder Bikes, Darth Vader's voice...I could go on and on about this unbelievable soundtrack.  Sound is so important to bring a movie to life and Lucas spared nothing on this soundtrack to give these classics a new dynamic feel.Overall, a MUST buy for any Star Wars fan.  These films have never looked or sounded better then they do in this aweinspiring release.  I am going to go out on a limb and say this is by far the best Blu Ray release of the year.  Do not fall into what so many have already done and not buy because of additions to the \"original\" theatrical version.  These additions are minor and do nothing to the overall enjoyment you will feel when watching these films in HD.  I encourage everyone to do what I did and buy these films and watch them for the first time, you will be amazed at all that HD has done for these films.  Amazon has an incredible price, highly recommended.\n",

            "In a film like DEAD ALIVE, the plot is basically pointless. The only reason it exists is to add some humor to the bloody gore-fest that erupts and since it's discussed so often, it isn't necessary to repeat again.  Basically, there will be two reasons you would want to see DEAD ALIVE. The most obvious reason is if you're a fan of movies with a lot of blood, guts, and gore.  DEAD ALIVE is the goriest film of all time (the lawnmower scene alone takes at least five minutes). For example, people are literally eaten alive and in full detail; a zombie is skinned alive but his bowels continue to live on and attempt to kill more live flesh; a zombie has his head turned into a lightbulb. If you like watching stuff like that, then this film is definitely for you (and if you have a weak stomach you should stay away at all costs). The other reason you may want to watch DEAD ALIVE is if you're a Peter Jackson fan. This is one of Jackson's earlier films and has become an important part of his filmography (but if you like Jackson, but have a weak stomach, don't watch this movie). Overall, DEAD ALIVE is the goriest film of all time and it contains a lot of humor (such as the Kung-Fu priest) but of the morbid and perverse kind. Only recommended for gore fans or Peter Jackson fans.\n",

            "This 1951 SF film shows of course its age, but is still a darn good watch! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.A new star is discovered near our solar system, on a collision course, approaching fast - VERY FAST! Some amongst scientific community believe it can pass near Earth, close enough to burn all life on our planet - and those are the optimists... Then, a planet orbiting this new star is discovered... I will say no more about the story.This film is based on a popular SF novel written in 1933 and therefore is definitely NOT linked to any kind of Cold War scares, unlike what some critics wrote back in the 50s. Far from being a parabol of nuclear war, both the book and the film are in fact SF variations on the theme of Deluge and Noah's Ark...This review will be short, because I really don't want to give away too much - so let me just say, that this film indeed is aged and yes, the plot has many holes, but it still remains a nice watch and of course a pretty powerful story, with the ending being particularly good.Actors are mostly forgotten today, even if both Richard Derr and Barbara Rush had a long and rather succesfull career, mostly on TV - she also played the main female character in another SF classic from 50s, &#34;It came from Outer Space&#34; (1953). Veteran specialists of second roles, Larry Keating and John Hoyt are in fact even more important in this film than actors who are in principle cast in leading roles.A sequel was planned, to be based on the second part of the book, &#34;After Worlds Collide&#34;, but ultimately the project was abandoned. A remake of this film was considered also already for some time, but for the moment it seems also that all those plans were shelved. And it may be for the better, because this film, with all its weaknesses, still packs some punch and is still a darn good watch. Enjoy!\n",

However, for the most part, the film is historically accurate and gives one an understanding of the feeling of battle.  Longstreet's ambivalence even comes across quite clearly.  At the same time, Maxwell does not lose sight of the fact that this is a dramatic movie, meaning to entertain as well as educate.  (This is something that Maxwell forgot when he directed the mediocre Gods and Generals.)  The DVD itself has a couple of nice extras.  A great bargain for the price.

            "Aladdin is true, classic, Disney magic. It has everything I've always wanted from my animated movies: gorgeous visuals, laugh-aloud humour, sing-along songs, an appealing hero, and a heroine little girls can feel good about looking up to. I was glad to see this movie get Disney's Platinum treatment -- it's my favourite Disney film, and getting to watch this new, restored DVD took me right back to being six years old and seeing it for the first time.There's real magic in this movie, something that I feel Disney's lost in the last few years. Aladdin is a great hero, relying on his brains and wit rather than brute strength and a sword, and his opposite number is absolutely insidious, a true love-to-hate villain. Robin Williams as the Genie is outstanding, and I know I've come to appreciate his humour a lot more as I've gotten old enough to understand all the references he makes in his wonderful ad-libbed tangents. Alan Mencken's score is just fabulous -- sweeping and epic, with songs that are both touching and humours by turns. \"One Jump Ahead\", \"Friend Like Me\", and \"Prince Ali\" delight and amuse, while the \"One Jump Ahead\" reprise offers pathos to Aladdin's character. And of course, the show-stopping \"A Whole New World\" still makes my heart soar and my inner romantic swoon gloriously. It's far and away my favourite Disney love song.My favourite thing about this movie, though, is and has always been Jasmine. She was the first heroine I really admired, because she was the first to take her destiny into her own hands and really go for what she wanted. She's strong, intelligent, and independant -- and she had a temper, and yelled, which always made me like her a lot more than those sweet, softspoken, entirely too passive heroines of earlier years. Her yearning for freedom, her desire to be her own person -- those are things I've come to appreciate a lot more as I've gotten older. She's so appealing, and a great role model for little girls -- certainly moreso than other heroines who would try to teach our daughters that they should be quiet and gentle and let the men do all the adventuring!This is my favourite Disney movie, and it's still highly entertaining, even after so many years. I recommend this to any Disney fan, anyone with children, and anyone with a kid still lurking somewhere inside herself. It's a true delight!\n",

            "I saw this movie as a recommendation as one of the best written comedy/movies of the all time.Well, I wouldn't say it's one of the best but it's pretty good.  First, hats off to Kevin Smith for the unique  perspective of a movie about clerks.  Also, a hats off to the actors  because I don't know if regular actors can do something like this.  These  actors are a lot more believable than say if you get big name actors to  play the characters parts.  Last, hats off for making an entertaining movie  without the big budget.That's where &quot;Clerks&quot; is a winner.  It's not big-budgeted, you get non major names to play roles.  The acting  is not top notch but they look as if they do fit those parts.  The more  believable these actors are to their characters, the more humorous the  movie was for me.As for quality video and audio, this was a low budget  movie, so I wasn't going to expect any major video/audio at all.  As for  the special features, the audio commentary was funny but terrible in a way  that you can't really hear the actors speak.  It's like one microphone was  being used. This was a big minus for the DVD.  Why put it in there if you  can't hear it that well.  The alternate ending was a shock and it's very  good they didn't include it in the final release.  It would of made the  movie very depressing.  The Soul Asylum music video rocked and how it stays  with the &quot;Clerks&quot; theme made watching the music video that much  more enjoyable.  If there was anything very negative about this DVD, it's  that this DVD continues to be one of the most expensive ones out there.  Otherwise, thank God for DVD coupons.So, if you want to see a fun  movie, &quot;Clerks&quot; will definitely make you laugh.\n",

You have deprived yourself of one of the best indie films of the 1990s, not to mention one of the better gut buster comedies ever!  \"Clerks\" is the first (major) project by Kevin Smith and it follows the lives of a few New Jersey based characters, but mainly Dante.  Dante is a clerk in a convenience store and he pretty much hates his miserable job, which is destroying him slowly.  His spicy little girlfriend encourages him to go back to school.  Randal, his outspoken best friend and a worker at the video store next door, tires to help out his bud but often helps to paint Dante into a corner.  Also, Randal's definition of friendship is wavy. You wouldn't think that a little quick-stop store would be much for an exciting adventure, but craziness does ensue as both Dante and Randal meet an annoying cast of customers (most notably Jay and Silent Bob) and somehow manage to squeeze a hockey game and a funeral into the day.  And I haven't even told you just some of the snide sarcastic jabs that keep getting thrown around.  Comedy is a defense mechanism and it works!The great thing about Clerks is that it doesn't try for cheap laughs, yet just every movement and line is great comedy.  Of course, its not like \"Clerks\" is a drama, but its just that nearly everything about it gets you.  Yes, it's all in a rough black and white and the budget is nill, but the material is so strong that it doesn't matter!  \"Clerks\" is the rare gem of a comedy that, luckily, never got a real squeal.  There was the little seen yet entreating \"Clerks\" cartoon, but it really left you wanting more.  Of course, Kevin did continue to use the characters again (Jay and Silent Bob mostly), but never totally rehashed the Clerks story that much.  \"Clerks\", the movie is classically irreverent and real, not like most of the insufferable sight gag shtick that people are so attracted to.  The DVD has a hilarious audio commentary, a Soul Asylum video (ah, remember them!) and deleted scenes and s shocking alternate ending.  The audio commentary is funny and gives us a lot of insight as to how the movie was made, some of the people in it and give us a few laughs along the way.

For that's what happens to poor John as one Dr.Noymann in a radiation accident.After his funeral he rises from the dead and visits a friend Dr.Penner,played by another veteran actor Philip Tonge(the department store manager in Miracle on 34th Street).Penner is told by his old friend that he is indeed dead but his body is inhabited by a creature from outer space who,along with many others already there,plan to take over the world.He is given the opportunity to warn the worlds' powers but no one believes him.Eventually the aliens are forced to take drastic action which awakens the world to their presence.Dr.Penner,his daughter,her boyfriend and an air force Major Jay(John Agar) take refuge in a mountain hideout to come up with a solution,as the world is at the brink of destruction at the hands of the alien controlled undead.The solution arrived at is a sound ray that forces the entities to leave the host bodies and then die.Earth one,aliens nothing.Carradine and Tonge bring their combined acting experiences together which helps an otherwise tepid movie.Because of them the movie at times can appear better than it is.It does move along relatively well and it is a decent little time waster.Unlike the flip side movie here,Journey to the Seventh Planet.Journey puts the \"bad\" into the B-movie.It concerns a journey to Uranus(the 7th planet).While the credits roll the rocket ship is passing Jupiter,then Saturn.Come the opening scenes of the film,we see Mars and the captain asks their location.The response is that they just passed the moon and they should be coming up on Mars! Maybe they liked Uranus so much this movie is about their second journey(?).No matter,just before they land an alien energy/mind force freezes the crew ,explaining it has plans to take over their minds and bodies and destroy them.They land on the planet and discover a breathable atmosphere and the landscape is forested.Upon further exploration they discover they are in a protective force barrier outside of which is the real atmosphere of the planet.They also discover that the creature is making many of their thoughts and desires come true,and where male astronauts are involved there has to be some females to amuse them,which dutfiully appear along the way.Outside the barrier they finally discover the creatures'lair and they hurt it enough to escape in their space ship.A real head scratching moment comes(and there are many!)as they board to leave.Outside is waiting one of the captain's \"mirage\" women and for some reason he takes her aboard.All along he has been warning the others to keep their distance,that they aren't real and should be avoided;yet he does that!?? Well just after take off the \"mirage\" lady becomes just that and disappears before the crew as background music swells up as that chart topping tune of the day \"Journey to the 7th Planet\"plays.Who'd have guessed? This plot is SO weak,the acting so stilted and the aliens so mundane that you wish this MOVIE had gone to Uranus and stayed for the duration.John Agar from Invisible Invaders also plays in this stinker too and adds to the dullness from begining to merciful end.Both films are in remarkable shape technically speaking,however.Invaders is in B&W; (full screen) and Journey is in colour in a nice widescreen format.Both prints are very good and quite clear and crisp.Unfortunately this can't extricate this release from its' two star fate.Invaders is the most appealing of the two with Journey falling far,far behind.I can only see this having appeal to the most compleatist of Sci-Fi fans out there or those who have a tinge of nostalgia for one or both of these flatulant flicks!\n",

            "Reviled by some, beloved by many, consistently referred to as the most  popular movie musical ever made, THE SOUND OF MUSIC more than fulfills the  promise of its beautiful visuals and expert song numbers on home video via  DVD.  This edition tops the 1995 laserdisc by allowing the sparkling,  exemplary design of its 70mm. Todd-AO frame to be exhibited with increased  sharpness and resolution.  The 4.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack is powerful and  clean, but since this film was originally mixed for six-track magnetic  stereo, it's curious why the effort wasn't made by Fox to split the  surrounds!  Nonethless, the film sounds terrific. The extra features make  this package a bargain at the price.  Full length commentary by director  Bob Wise, with the musical numbers presented sans vocals, is a great touch.  And the two documentaries are beautifully presented; full of facts and  bits of arcane information that any fan will truly enjoy. A great movie,  and a great DVD rendition.

            "When I bought my blu ray player, I couldn't get this movie fast enough. This is hands down my favorite horror move.  What makes this so fantastic is that is has very little blood, and a ton of suspense.  My favorite parts is when a character is doing something, then the camera pans, then you see that Michael is there....lurking in the shadows. Fantastic!For those of you who don't know, this is about a boy that was institualized for killing his older sister on Halloween night. The one day, he escapes and heads back home to continue the killing. He picks one teen ( I wont' say why) and goes after her. If anyone gets in his way, then that's their problem. Along the way, his doctor, Dr. Loomis heads back to Michael's hometown in order to stop him.  That's all I really want to say on the plot.This is such a fantastic movie! It was a lot of suspense that will keep you glued to your seat. I can't say enough good things about Halloween.The transfer to blu ray is wonderful! The sound is crisp and clear. The images are vivid and sharp. This is the way Halloween was meant to be seen.  This has a fantastic extra. It's called \"Fast Facts\". If you set the setting's for the \"Fast Facts\" you get to see little facts about the movie (about the stars, production ect) that add a wonder aspect to a great movie.This is a classic and a must have.\n",

This film was made in 1978 and I thought it would be a nice scary film with plenty of scares and gore boy was i wrong. I rented this movie to see if it was worth a buy no not worth it to me comeon Michael Myers scary no way. He looks like some weirdo who wears a plastic mask.The acting in this film blew the charecters were eh and I am like this film is no good.I wont buy this film cause it is a bomb and not in a good way. If you want to see a scary movie with a scarier killer in it watch A Nightmare on Elm Street with Freddy Kreuger in it or the Friday the 13th films with Jason Voorhees in it.I mean The Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie from 1974 was way better then this pile of utter trash the only thing i liked about this film was when it ended. i give this lousy film 1 star if i could give it 0 stars I would so not worth it. THis looks like a PG13 film other then the nudity of course. This film isnt scary doesn't give Horror movie lovers like me the gore and the scares that we want the only thing this film has going for it is the nude scene with the woman. Thats not saying much. This film is way way overrated for those people that gave this film 3 stars and up must not like gory horror films with a good story o well to each his or her own I suppose.\n",

            "Does this have a good picture?\n",
            "Okay, let's be brief: If you didn't grow up in the horror lovin' 80's or are not an established fan of Italian horror films, this movie probably won't work for you. This is the unofficial sequel to Romero's \"Dawn Of The Dead\" (the 1978 version of course) made primary for Italian audiences when Dawn was released there under the title of \"Zombi\". Even though this one doesn't take place in a mall or feature anything or anyone like the original storyline of Dawn, it does have almost the same feel. Eventually in America, this film came to us with English dubbed audio under the title of \"Zombie\". But now Shriek Show has finally released a remastered 2 disc set of this classic movie fully uncut for the first time in the states.Or so I thought.Ya see, when the movie starts, there's a brief scene set-up (as it always was), then it goes into the opening credits. I was expecting to see the original Italian credits showing it finally under it's original title \"Zombi 2\", like the box. But it isn't, it's the American version with the title \"Zombie\". Nitpicking, huh? But after a little searching I found an Easter Egg that shows that original title sequence that finally shows that this film was called \"Zombi 2\". Here's how to get to it (it's easy....):On Disc One go to the \"Features\" section. In there, press the number \"6\" on your remote. It will activate a red skull button in the upper right on the screen (you CAN'T activate it by searching around the menu with your arrow buttons, very rare by Easter Egg standards!), and it will press the button automatically and take you to the original Italian opening credits and clearly show that this film was called \"Zombi 2\", logo and all. Also, after they're done, it will show an alternate end credits, but honestly I couldn't see any difference on them as opposed to the ones on the movie now.All in all, this movie has never looked or sounded better ever. Some say it's looks too cleaned up now. They might have a point because the picture is so perfect now (colors bright, sharp image, brightness exact, sound crisp, etc) that it gives away the effects in the movie. Well, I'd rather have this movie perfect picture than a dark, grainy VHS anyday.This movie is a classic piece of horror history and should be owned (especially the Shriek Show 25th Anniversary version...the extras here are superior....the making of documentary is as long as the movie itself!) by anyone with two or more \"Living Dead/Zombie\" DVD's already in their collection. I'm glad I got it, THIS is the way classic horror should be re-released.P.S.: If you look hard enough (the DVD's trailer section has their previews), there is a \"Zombi 3\" and a \"Zombie 4\" movies out there too. Trust me, you don't need them or want them, as they don't have the same feel or quality of \"Zombi 2\" or \"Dawn Of The Dead\". Just be happy with their trailers. Enjoy!\n",

            "Why her character is really enjoyable?\n",
            "This movie has a lot going for it, Superb animation, memorable songs, the characters on the whole are very likable, though a couple of improvements could have been made. Starting with Anastasia herself. Who seemed a bit too  self centered for my tastes. Which is pretty common with female characters  in most animated films, but she in particular seems to be driven ONLY by  her own needs. Wanting to know about her past and finding her family is  fine, but it would have been nice if she had be shown to express concern  for, or helping out someone else during the course of the movie.  To this  day I still think the most enduring female character in an animated movie  has to be Mrs. Frisby from The Secret of Nimh. A character motivated not by  finding Prince Charming, but who's strife and hidden courage comes from  trying to save the life of her child. A character you truly feel for. I  really wish more characters could be written like that.It would have  also been better to see more of why Rasputin hated the Romanovs so much,  which BTW makes you wonder, if he was out to obliterate the Romanovs  completely why didn't he go after the Grandmother, wasn't she one too?I  do believe Anastasia is a really good film, if not perfect, and I recommend  seeing it. And after you do, check out The Secret of Nimh, which I think is  Don Bluth's BEST animated film!\n",

            "Is the video good?\n",
            "Unlike many of the currently posted reviews, I'm going to be reviewing the actual release, rather than speculating or complaining about the cover EDIT-Amazon now lists the proper cover shot as to what was used on the release).I received my Blu Ray of Destroy All Monsters today and promptly dropped it into the Blu Ray player.I commend Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock for releasing this one.From a story perspective, all the giant monsters are collected on a single island (Monster Island) for research purposes. Contact is lost with the control facility and what is discovered is that a race of aliens has taken control of the giant monsters. The giant monsters are sent to many different cities across the world and the human race must then wrestle control of the giant monsters back from the aliens. Fun stuff!Video:I'm torn here. I really, really wanted to love this release. What is there is 1080p HD in name, but the detail quality seems kind of low. I don't know what happened, but the colors seem washed out and faded while there are some instances of dust and dirt to be seen. Interestingly enough, you can still see the control cables and wires used for various special effects, so perhaps this was the best that could be done with it? I've read (and a commenter stated the possibility) that the source was a 35mm print.In my mind, the Blu Ray doesn't look to be much better than an upscaled DVD. I don't have the Media Blasters DVD to compare directly, so I don't know if it really is an upscale or not, but every indication points to this being a true HD source.Disappointing from an HD perspective certainly. If this is the same quality that was released in Japan (can't verify myself, sorry), then that tells me it is a source issue, but I don't know because I can't compare.Forums I've been to indicate this is the same master used on the Japanese release, but take that for what it is worth without validation.Audio:5.1 Japanese, along with 2.0 Japanese and English 2.0 (2 audio streams for English). I watched in Japanese 5.1 and the music and effects seem to be well separated in the front speakers, while the rear channels barely got much use. Since this was original recorded in 2.0 stereo anyway, I flipped over and I have to say the stereo separation is just about as good in my mind as the 5.1 in Japanese.I spot checked the English audio tracks and they seem to be on par in terms of audio quality as the Japanese. In terms of the quality of the English dub, I leave that to others to decide. Seems OK to me, but I expect hokey English on my giant monster movies anyway!Based on a comment on my review, I went back to check the English dub. I can confirm, without question, that BOTH the AIP AND the \"International\" Toho dub are, in fact, on this disc. Both English tracks are, however, in 2.0 Stereo ONLY. There is no 5.1 English dub. Not that most people who wanted the AIP dub would care that much, considering the film was in 2.0 stereo originally anyway.Packaging:For those of you in love with the image Amazon has up, be prepared to be disappointed. Or not, if you hated it. From the time it was displayed here to time of release, the cover has been changed. If you check out the Destroy All Monsters wikipedia entry, this release uses the poster artwork displayed there. It looks good to me.Otherwise the packaging is pretty bare bones. No inserts in the case or anything. Serviceable, but at $30 MSRP I'd have hoped for something a little better.Extras:Commentary is pretty good. Very nice to have it included.All of the trailers are in standard definition, which is OK I suppose.All of the Extras content is 480i and NOT 1080p.You get original trailers (English, Japanese, French (poor audio quality), RADIO spots for the AIP dub (English only with still images from the film) ), a storyboard image gallery, an 8mm reel from AIP (quality is poor, but it's still really cool to see this!) and image gallery.In my original Amazon review I ended up passing over a lot of the extras, so for that, I am terribly sorry.The extras on this disc are pretty fantastic in my mind. Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock put a lot of love into pulling together all of this material.Final Verdict:Destroy All Monsters is one of the best Godzilla movies around. It deserves to be owned, certainly. The Blu Ray release is probably the prettiest release the movie has seen, though that's not saying much with some of the previous releases.I've given it 4 stars because of the sloppy video (possibly not Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock's fault, I don't know). What is outstanding is the audio. Video drops the review by a star.If you don't already own it and enjoy the film, this is definitely worth picking up. If you are OK with the video quality on prior release and don't care about the AIP dub, keep your money.If you want the AIP English dub, this is THE release to get.Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock did an outstanding job on this release. Pulling together the trailers, the radio spots and even the commentary shows me that they actually appreciate the release as much as many fans. The video quality is the only mar on an outstanding release and it is something I can look past, as I've since learned that the video is from Toho's own remastered (in 2008) video.If you are a Godzilla fan, this is definitely worth the purchase price without question.\n",

You will have to buy the four disc edition for other material. This movie is a Digital Transfer capturing a HIGHER RESOLUTION from the RESTORED PICTURE. The picture is fabulous and the sound is very clear. The price was reasonable at $4.50. I could have paid extra for the 4 Disc Edition but this edition is great and captures that vivid Technicolor image. Part 1 is on the first disc and ends with Scarlett saying \"As God as my witness I'll never be hungry again!\" The second disc has the rest of the movie.Olivia de Havilland was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Vivien Leigh and Hattie McDaniel (Mammy) won Academy Awards. Hattie McDaniel was the first African American to win an Academy Award.

When he is taken, along with his son, to the concentration camps, it is so touching to see the lengths he goes to, as a father, to hide the truth of their actual situation. Roberto Benigni won an Oscar for his role and the film won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. Both were well deserved. I highly recommend this film.\n",

It got a lot of hype because of it's  &quot;inventive&quot; documentary style (this has been used before, see  some cult horror movies). It got too much hype, so much that the final  product couldn't live up to it, especially if you're seeing it now.While  Blair Witch does have some genuinely scary moments, they are precious few.  I kept getting the feeling that the film's style was just a gimmick rather  than an actual attempt at making it look like a documentary.

The battle scenes outdo anything in the original trilogy! I'll grant that it doesn't have the underlying heavy mythology of the original movies, but that's because it _is_ the underlying heavy mythology of the original movies. The plot is kind of convoluted, but you should be able to make sense of everything if you pay close attention. If not, just enjoy the visuals.The DVD itself is outstanding. The picture and sound are perfect and there are plenty of extras, including an hour-long documentary focusing on the making of the movie. Rick McCallum is hilarious. My favorite extra is the first web featurette, showing George Lucas going to work on his first day of writing the script (November 1, 1994).

My favorite feature was the deleted scenes. It was SO much fun. Actually most of the deleted scenes were added on the dvd version of the movie except for a few. The only thing I didn't like about the movie itself was Jake Lloyd the actor who played Anakin. I know he needed to have similar features to Luke Skywalker but I think they could've found a better actor. His facial expressions never cahnged. He had the same expression on his face when he was happy, sad, scared, or bored. But after all he was 9 or younger when they started filming so I guess I shouldn't be to hard on him. Despite that I still give it 5 stars. I'm going to wait for Episode II to come out on DVD and skip the VHS version. If I absolutly can't wait I'll just rent it. George Lucas, if you read this, please don't wait to bring 4-6 out on DVD until after number 3 is out. That would be horrible. Actually I doubt us fans will allow that to happen.

Many people complained to no end about it. But, when get past the hype and internet complaints, you have yourself a pretty decent movie.  Sure it had some bad parts.  Okay, it had some REALLY bad parts. The story wasn't all that fascinating, tha characterization is weak, Darth Vader's an exuberant little kid, And Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying character ever.  But the movie is still worthy of the Star Wars title.  I can't tell you how many times I was in gasping in awe of the sheer visuals in the film.  To me, the good redeems the movie for it's worser parts.  As for the legions of fans who hated this movie, I think they were expecting it to be like the first time theysaw Star Wars.  News flash for you folks: it's a slim chance that you'll ever have that experience again in your life.

The acting is mostly bad, Liam Neeson, Ray Park, and Ian McDiarmand are good in this film, Ewan McGregor was quite disappointing when you compare this performance in the other two prequels to this, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd are terrible, Lloyd is the impossible not to hate character with his moon face and his overracting, Portman is usually good but failed due to having the weirdest voice I have ever heard in a SW movie. This movie has three good characters (Qui Gonn, The Emperor, and Darth Maul) but has some of the worst like Little Anakin, Sebulba, Jar Jar, Boss Nass, and Queen Amidala's Decoy. The film has many problems but has enough to make up for it. Darth Maul is a flatout badass as he goes on Tatooine in search of the jedi, The action is pretty good, The lightsaber duel at the end is a fantastic scene and that's what gives the movie my rating. Rating: 7.5/10\n",

            "Okay, I was just like everyone else--I wanted to see this movie really really badly.  So I did.  And at first I thought it was great!  But later, I realized how very childish this movie is.  Sure, the visual effects were nice, and the pod race was cool, but the visuals can't compare with The Matrix.  Also, Jar Jar Binks and Boss Nass are a very unwelcome addition, with their very eyeball-rolling senses of humor.  And the plot wasn't very clever either.  It's really pretty hard to relate this movie to the Trilogy.  If you're anyone under 13 (as I was when I saw it), you should like at the very least like it, as long as you don't expect it to be like the old Star Wars.  But if you are an adult who is a big fan of the Trilogy, avoid The Phantom Menace at all costs.Rated PG, for sci-fi action and violence, not much else, really everyone should be allowed to see it.  But the question remains: does EVERYONE really WANT TO?\n",

            "Get ready to be swept away by the next installment of one of the most loved and watched sci-fi movies of all time... Star Wars Episode One. It sounds more exciting than the actual experience of watching this slow, drab, feckless piece of work. I'm a huge Star Wars (episode 4-6) fan like many others but this new installment was bad Han Solo not firing first bad.Story (lacked originality): The story is fundamentally sound there is good vs. bad and the battles for who will prevail. Jedi knights get entangled in rescuing themselves along with a queen from an evil corrupt federation. There are amusing fights with the Federation standard robot army. They bounce around the galaxy and end up finding a very young boy on a remote planet we've already been to TWO times before. The boy displays natural ability in regards to the force but lacks any acting talent. A cool evil sith lord is introduced but given an anorexic amount of lines. Viewers will visit the galactic capital Coursant but this is less entertaining then a Disneyland commercial. These stories are meant to sweep us away and take us to new worlds where we're simply awed and amazed. I ended up being awed by how bad the acting and script were and amazed my beloved series has been reduced to dribble.Acting (mostly below average): Do I start with the bad news or the good news. Well I don't really have a whole lot of good news except several gifted actors/actresses starred in this movie (Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, Liam Neelson plus the original C-3PO actor). The problem was none of there performances were above par when compared to there previous works. In fact this movie didn't bring out there talent but seemed to siphon it. Then there are the already bad actors. There performances are out right criminal. We're stuck watching the main character a young boy who for one is a bad actor and for two is put in ridicules situations that again took away from this movie. I can't even start with Jar Jar yet it hurts too much to speak his name.Script (god awful): George Lucas must have been on the can when he wrote this script. The lines are chalky and lack originality. You're stuck time after time hearing a regurgitated lines stolen from the original movies. The script feels like jigsaw puzzles that doesn't have any of the right pieces. There isn't smooth transition from one part of the movie to the next. It all feels either rushed or awkward. The movie also becomes very complex but in a 20 car pile up sort of way. Your shown glimpses of the galactic senate and taken into the honored Jedi Counsel Halls but no one seems to have motives that make sense. The Federation is being very naughty to the planet of Naboo but why doesn't the galactic republic army crush them? Is there a galactic republic army? If not then how do they maintain power since no strong government ever does without a military. Why doesn't the Federation simply attack Crousant and go for the gold if they don't have a military? You literally see about ten Galactic soldiers I mean this is the capital for the whole universe and there is only ten soldiers come on give me a break. Unfortunately not even Yodas few witty lines could save us from this mostly stale experience. Yoda mostly reminded me that this movie isn't about creating a new cutting edge craft but about attempting to relive the past.Music (Fair): The music as a whole is only fair. I'm not blaming John Williams the man had nothing to work with. That being said the music is one of the better parts to this movie. The end Sith battle music is powerful with a strong chorus added to the orchestra. The effect was moving but little to late in this already flat experience.Most the fight scenes are cool but others are ruined by Jar Jar and Anakin. The end Sith lord light saber battle actual had some emotion. The only problem was the Sith lord was the most interesting character and he was never given a chance to shine due to him not given hardly any lines or back story. He does however wield a sweet double bladed light saber. All this being said a lot of younger viewers love this new installment and fail to see the plethora of flaws that ensue. For any one who isn't a fan of Star Wars or enjoys solid movies with a plot feel free to pass on this popular yet boring movie.\n",

I was wrong.Technically, both the video and audio quality are excellent.  In terms of value, the extra features, most especially the commentary by some of the military personnel who were present, are alone worth the price of admission.  As far as the movie itself, this is a great one.  The story is compelling, especially since it's based on an actual event.  The directing is top-notch.

            "This film is based on a real life event so that it is difficult to review. One can find that the events portrayed and the way that they are portrayed can become more important than the actual impact of the film as an entertainment.The reality of the operation portrayed by the film was that the United States sent some peace keeping troops to Somalia, a country which had broken down to endemic civil war and had virtually ceased to function. The United States forces formed the view that this problem would be solved if some of the more major war lords were taken out of the equation. This film is about an attempt to kidnap the most important war lord in Somalia General Adid. The plan of the operation was to drop some highly trained troops by helicopter around a building. They were to arrest the war lord and then a convoy of vehicles was to remove him to the United States base. The operation went horribly wrong with two helicopters being shot down and the road convey getting lost. As a result a number of American soliders were killed and their bodies mutilated and dragged through the streets by the Somalis. Other troops held out and were rescued by a force of Malaysians the next morning. The operation like any real life situation contained confused elements. On one hand there was the bravery of the soldiers on the ground, both the United States soldiers who went through hell and also that of the Somalis. Whilst the individual soldiers and pilots acted generally in a way that was beyond what could reasonably be expected of them the planning of the operation and the concept behind it was deeply flawed.The film caters mainly to an American audience and for that reason it works to show the bravery of the American's involved. There can be no argument with this as they surely were. However the film tends to oversimplify the conflict by demonising the Somalis and by not looking at the sheer stupidity of what those soldiers had to go through. The reality is that the various deaths were for nothing as the United States forces were quickly pulled out. There are some minor reconstructions of history to downplay the role of the Malaysians and to suggest that the Americans had a greater role in the rescue than they in fact had.If we leave aside these minor historical quibbles the film is surprisingly effective. It conveys a complex series of battles in a way that is clear and lets the viewer understand what is happening. The portrayal of the actual fighting is also reasonably accurate. (Apart from what is said above some scences featuring Eric Banna are also made up)The film is also quite long, yet it passes quickly and one does not really have a sense of the time one is viewing it. One of Ridley Scott's better outings in a while.\n",

            "This is simply the greatest war film ever made. Ever. And I've seen a TON of war films. Im hoping Speilberg makes a similar movie about the Marines in the pacific (Thin Red Line just wasnt that good). Using a new style of filming, the crew ran alongside the actors in every scene, giving the viewer the sense of actually being there with the troops (if that feeling is EVER possible through film). This film is simply brilliant. And powerful. Also fantastic is the audio. The sounds of bullets whizzing by overhead and \"pinging\" off metal had me actually ducking in the movie theater. Apparently, it was too real for many veterans who subsequently had to leave the theater.'Saving Private Ryan\" starts in the American cemetery in Normany where some thousands upon thousands upon thousands of American soldiers are buried in endless rows of beautiful white stone crosses. The scenery is simply beautiful, with the English Channel in the backround. Then the horror starts. It's June 6, 1944. Early morning. The soldiers of Tom Hank's Ranger batallion are headed for Omaha beach in a crammed Higgins boat. They're terrified, they're sick and they're cold. Many have never seen combat before. The Germans are dropping shells all around their boat. You feel like you're there with these boys. Your hands are sweaty, you're nervous. Your nauseous. You know what they're in for. So do they, and thats what makes this scene so utterly horriying. They know when that ramp drops to unload them on the beach they're probably gonna die. Are you insane by this point??? Are you resigned to the fact that you're gonna die?? Or are you so utterly terrified that you're numb???? Speilberg captures all this. He's a brilliant director.Then the boys hit shore and the ramp drops. The first 5 soldiers are immediately shot in the head and drop. The rest clamor out of the boat, terrified. Literally running for their lives. They climb over the sides, they jump out the front and into the waist high water. Some are shot to peices. Some drown under the weight of their packs. You feel all of this. You're there!!!!! The German artillery and machine gun fire is unrelenting. It's like a wave of lead showering these poor souls from every and all angles. Again, Speilberg is a genius.Some of the boys make it to the beach.....then the real horror begins. Much has been said about the first 20 minutes of this movie.....too gruesome, too violent. Sickeneing. How can a movie that depicts what living Americans (or any human for that matter) experienced be described as \"too\" anything???? That's where I part ways with the critics. This is what they lived through. This is part of many peoples experince. This was their life. To think that there are many older people walking around today who actually LIVED THROUGH experiences like this is almost too much to think about. Do they think about it all day everyday for the rest of their lives??? Do they dream about it every night?? Do they have flashbacks that result from certain sounds or smells??? Do they relive it?? Are you insane on the inside but appear \"ok\" to the everyday passerby?? Maybe even to your family??This movie is simply wonderful. The whole movie. Tom Hanks gave this character his all. Mostly because he respected the character and knew that he was representing an entire generation of human beings for whom this experience of war was real. If you havent seen this movie, buy it now. Watch it in surround sound.......go to war. You'll come away with a whole new respect for those old men you see who 60 years later are still wearing hats with the insignia of their company or batallion on it. And you'll understand why.\n",

            "The epic starts here.It was hard to fathom The Lord Of The Rings ever becoming a live-action motion picture. Two horribly failed attempts to animate the story (both failed so miserably the funding was pulled before they could be completed) proved the work was too big, too complicated and too adored by readers to be translated less than perfectly. On top of that Tolkien created this thick, complex world and languages that could not easily be shown or translated to the screen.But Peter Jackson did it.From the grand opening shots of the Shire, to the showdown with the Balrog, this is a moving, stirring, emotional spectacle. A masterpiece.The episodic first installment covers the handing over of the one ring from Hobbit Bilbo to nephew Frodo, neither of whom know the rings powers or origin. A dark force, Sauron, who forged the ring of power to control the lords and kings of Man, Elves and Dwarves. Existing only as a powerful spirit, a great fiery eye, Sauron searches tirelessly for the ring that can bring him back to form and power. When Wizard Gandalf figures out the nature of the ring (in an abiding Duh! moment) he hurries Frodo - who is quickly joined by fellow hobbits Merry, Pippin and loyal servant Samwise - away from the shire so that Gandalf can figure what the enemy is up to, plot a course of action and find a way for Frodo to be released of his task of baring the desperately hunted ring of power. He fails, being capture by turned-evil wizard Saruman and does not meet up with Frodo at the designated place and time.Frodo and friends being pursued by Dark Riders, the kings of men possessed by the one ring and now Ring Wraiths, is taken under wing by Stryder, a mysterious Vagabond who seems to know more about Frodo that Frodo.The journey takes them to Rivendell, one of home of the elves, and master Elrod. A council of Man, Wizard, Dwarf and Hobbit is convened and nine go forward to destroy the ring, by carrying it into the stronghold of Sauron and casting it into the fire from which it was forged.The Quest take Frodo and Company to the top of a mountain nearly brought down by Saruman to the mines of Moria, where the entire population of Dwarfs mining it have been slaughtered and the Fellowship must face an impress army of thousands of orcs, a cave troll and the satan-like Balrog.In the end the story concludes by not solving anything, but leaving us open for the next film.The ride is breathtaking, the sets are amazing, the costumes, acting, directing, music and sound are all dead on perfect. Peter Jackson never lets the camera stop moving and knows how to film action in a personal and involving way that is rarely seen. This grand operatic quest is on a scale never before seen and the DVD and Dolby or DTS sound are brilliant. There's nearly an over abundance of commentary tracks here, nearly everyone involved gets one, the actors and director / writer are the hands down best and worth the four hours to listen to.Never mind the theatrical version, that was great this is grand.

            "I've been a Tolkien devotee for nearly 25 years and have needlessly raised my hopes over several attempts at bringing his masterwork to the screen, but Peter Jackson has done justice to what many agree may be the best literary work of the 20th century. This initial dvd offering features two discs -- one for the film itself (as released in theaters) and another for special features. ( A four-dvd edition will be released in November 2002.)The film is a remarkable and faithful adaptation of the first volume of Tolkien's trilogy. Jackson masterfully carries this literary masterpiece into the 21st century with breathtaking sets, gorgeous costumes, sumptuous music, gloriously eye-popping special effects, and a touching attention to detail that evokes history-laden cultures. One does miss Tom Bombadil, and wonder why screenwriters decided to make Frodo ignorant of Bilbo's imminent departure from the Shire for example, but mostly one can understand the cinematic justification for changes that were made and just bathe in this beautiful film -- whether or not you are a devotee of JRR. If you are hesitant to see this film for fear of being disappointed -- race out and get it now. You will NOT be disappointed. From the introductory voiceover to a beautifully realized Hobbiton, the opening is mesmerizing and the film just keeps getting better, in some ways revealing Tolkien's rich and complex world even more clearly than the books. The characters are well-realized and the cast is exquisite. You can tell that the people who worked on this adaptation cared about the books even more than they cared about the bottom dollar, and I hope the awards start rolling in for Jackson, his right-hand man Richard Taylor and their talented cast and crew.The special features include: three documentary features -- \"Welcome to Middle Earth\" (a publisher's in-store feature, 17 minutes), \"Quest for the Ring\" (originally aired on Fox TV, 22 minutes), and \"A Passage to Middle Earth\" (originally seen on the Sci Fi Channel, 40 minutes); fifteen featurettes about the cultures and locations depicted in the film; two teasers, a trailer and six tv spots; a preview of the extended dvd edition due out November 12, 2002; a preview of Entertainment Arts' video game, \"The Two Towers\"; an 11-minute behind-the-scenes preview of the film, \"The Two Towers\"; and an Enya video. There is also a coupon and rebate booklet for such varied items as sword replicas, jewelry, posters, etc.\"Welcome to Middle Earth\" features a charming introduction to Robert Unwyn who, as a boy, originally reviewed The Hobbit for his publisher father and, fortunately for us all, gave the manuscript a thumbs-up with the comment \"should appeal to all children between the ages of 5 and 9\". Years later, as a publisher himself, he received the manuscript for The Lord of the Rings (originally presented as a single volume) and wrote to his father for advice, telling him that he thought the book was wonderful but would probably lose a thousand pounds; his father replied \"IF you believe this to be a work of genius, THEN you may lose the thousand pounds\" -- and off they went! This 17-minute feature also shows Tolkien's Oxford hall and home, describes two Houghton-Mifflin companion volumes and is really a wonderful treat for fans. The three features include interviews with Peter Jackson, WETA Workshop's Richard Taylor, artists Alan Lee and John Howe, and actors Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Billy Boyd, Cate Blanchett, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler and Sean Astin. The preview promises that \"The Two Towers\" will be amazing and one gets the impression that this team, as the fellowship members go their separate ways and new characters are introduced (including Gollum!), truly understand the story they are bringing to life, and will dazzle us all again soon.There is something to be said for waiting until November and getting the four-dvd special edition, which will include 30 extra minutes of film (particularly in Hobbiton and concerning Gimli's enchantment with Galadriel). But for those of you who cannot wait -- this two-dvd set is highly recommended.\n",

            "Gladiator wants to be Ben-Hur, really.  There's no denying that the costumes, sets, visual effects, and gore are spectacular, but that's where the glory ends.  Russell Crowe is powerful and convincing in his role as Maximus, and Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful as the sniveling coward Commodus, but the talents of these men are nearly overshadowed by the film's incredible length.Many of the scenes involve, of course, the gladiator contests, and it is in these that we see Maximus' power as both a survivor and superior fighter.  But in all honesty, about an hour into the movie, you feel as though you've been watching it much longer.  The film moves slowly and never seems to gain any real momentum.  You can fall asleep at many points in the movie, wake up, and be completely caught up in a few minutes, as I did.  The slaughter of Maximus' family doesn't quite pull at your heart like I think the director wanted it to.  I found myself more annoyed that Maximus wouldn't assume the power that Marcus was bequeathing him.That said, the extra DVD that accompanies the film is wonderful!  There are interviews, behind-the-scenes trivia, and a section of clips that ended up on the cutting room floor.  I really enjoyed watching the short segment on the costumes and special makeup required for the battle scenes.  The extra DVD has all sorts of goodies that are a DVD-owners dream!  If you're a big fan of the film and you own a DVD player, then this will be a great addition to your collection.The film is certainly worth seeing at least once for all of the special effects and Russell Crowe's amazing acting skills!\n",

            "What is the plot of the movie?\n",
            "A film by Chris ColumbusThis is the first film in the Harry Potter series and it is adapted from J.K. Rowling's novel of the same title.  A common complaint about movies that have been adapted from a book is that the movie strays too far from the book and that it makes too many changes.  This is sometimes necessary as film and novels are two different mediums and need to tell stories in different ways, but sometimes unnecessary changes are made.  Happily, this is not the case with this movie.  This movie is extremely faithful to the book, and I think the film works because of that.By now, many people probably have a good idea what Harry Potter is all about.  For those who are not in the know, here's the story for this movie.  Young Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is living with his aunt and his uncle because his parents died when he was an infant.  It is obvious they do not want him around as he is forced to live in the closet under the stairs and he is treated like a servant, an unwelcome servant at that.  One day owls start arriving at the house and deliver letters to Harry.  We see that the letters are from &quot;Hogwarts.&quot;  Harry's uncle keeps destroying the letters, but more come each day.  Finally he has had enough and Harry's Uncle takes the family (including Harry) to a remote island where no letters can reach them.  It is at this point that Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) finds Harry, tells him that Harry is a wizard, and that he is to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  See, Harry is a wizard, and is the son of a wizard.  Harry's parents were not killed in a car accident (as he had been told), but rather they were killed by the Dark Lord Voldemort, a wizard gone bad.  Harry is the boy who lived, which is why he is famous in the wizarding world.At Hogwarts, Harry makes friends with Ron Weasely (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and makes an enemy of Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).  Ron and Hermione are also first year students and are in Gryffindor House with Harry.  Draco is also a first year, but is in Slytherin House (Ron tells Harry that &quot;not a wizard went bad that wasn't in Slytherin&quot;).  Harry, Ron, and Hermione become good friends and get into little adventures together.  They believe that someone is trying to steal something called the Sorcerer's Stone and since no adult will believe them, they try to figure this out on their own.  At the same time, they are in the first year of school, so they have to go to their classes in magic.  A little bit of time is spent in each class so that we get a sense of the school and a sense of the magic of that Harry and friends are supposed to be learning.The movie is very faithful to the book, so most events from the book are included in this movie and while it is a fairly long movie (2 and a half hours), it moves along fast enough that you don't really feel like you've spent so much time.  One of the reasons you don't feel the time is that the acting is fantastic.  The actors are so perfect for their roles that they are almost exactly how I imagined the characters to be.  Two actors who stand out are Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore and Alan Rickman as Professor Snape.  Rickman, especially, is a delight to watch.  This role border's on Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) as one of his great characters.  The movie also features Maggie Smith (Professor McGonagall) and Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick).Even though I would recommend the book to anyone, I'm not convinced the movie is for everyone.  I thought that the movie captured the events and the spirit of the book, but is missing some of the charm.  Rowling's novel just sucks you in, but at times I thought the movie was only for fans of the book.  I really enjoyed the movie, and I will give it a good rating, but it may not convert people who don't really enjoy fantasy (or movies that have fantasy elements).\n",

            "It sounds cool, right? The Coen Brothers (&quot;Fargo,&quot; &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;) doing a retelling of Homer's The Odyssey, set in depression-era Mississippi, filled with a stellar soundtrack, the usual Coen cast plus George Clooney, and an homage to Preston Sturges. And it is pretty cool, but it's not great, and perhaps doesn't live up to its expectations. Undeniably, the music in the film is fantastic, and the soundtrack album is well worth buying. Clooney turns in a great performance in his first outing with the Brothers, and John Turturro, Holly Hunter, and John Goodman are great as well. Any fan of Homer or Sturges would be proud. However, the movie seems to fall short of what the viewer wants. It lacks the humor and the precise attention to complex and fascinating characters that we found in previous Coen Brothers films. The three bumbling escapees (Clooney, Turturro, and Tim Clarke Duncan) are the expected dim-witted good-hearted Southerners, and in the course of their odyssey to uncover the $1.2 million that Clooney stole and buried, meet a fanciful enough cast of weirdos. There's no laugh-out-loud oddballisms, no endearingly pathetic losers, no poorly thought out crime capers, to keep us really engaged. If it weren't for the music, I'd have checked out. In short, the film's worth seeing, but not keeping. Hey, we can't expect the best of these guys all the time.\n",

            "How the director describe the scene?\n",
            "This movie is just plain bad.  So many missed opportunities.  The screenplay is undermined by the all too predictable love triangle story.  Love and war tales only mixed well in 1980s network television mini-series.  PEARL HARBOR is too long and too complicated.  Additionally, and  unlike its predecessor TORA, TORA, TORA, the action scenes of PEARL HARBOR rely too heavily on CGI.  CGI is great in science fiction films, but appears as a phony video game image when representing actual aircraft.To their credit, the producers were able to borrow an aircraft carrier, fly actual and replica zero aircraft, as well as assembled flyable P-40 Warhawks and B-25 Mitchell bombers.  Unfortunately these aircraft scenes were fluffed up with computer generated images that removed all reality from aerial scenes.The ship scenes are credible, particularly the extensive recreation of the USS Oklahoma's capsizing.  If history alone carried the story this movie would have had a chance.  However, in PEARL HARBOR history played second fiddle to the romance.In PEARL HARBOR it is also annoying to find the main characters everywhere.  Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) begin their military service at Mitchell Field, Long Island.  Sorry Michael Bay, Long Island does not have any dry khaki foothills.  Here Rafe conveniently receives orders to join the Eagle Squadron and fight the Luftwaffe.  The RAF's Eagle Squadron was not an organization that was eligible for US Army Air Corps orders.  In order to participate in the Eagle Squadron -- or the Flying Tigers, for that matter -- an officer would have had to resign his commission and left the service.  Of course it was the only way to separate Rafe from his love interest Navy nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale).Rafe is shot down by a Messerschmitt and presumed dead thus freeing Evelyn to fall in love with Rafe's best friend Danny.  Danny's squadron along with Evelyn and her nurse peers find themselves shipped out to Hawaii.  Evelyn no sooner swoons for Danny when Rafe shows up. Not only is Rafe alive and well, he is also an ace.  The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor interrupts the romantic debacle as Rafe and Danny put aside their differences take to the air against the Zeros.  After some fancy CGI flying, both pilots return to donate blood for the wounded and rush off to the anchorage to assist with the rescue effort.Rafe and Danny then volunteer to become bomber pilots and join General Doolittle in his raid on Tokyo.  Danny sacrifices his life to save Rafe and resolving the uneasiness between the two over Evelyn.  Thus Rafe is free to return to a pregnant Evelyn and both remember Danny through his son.War and romance do not mix.  ENEMY AT THE GATES was proof of that.PEARL HARBOR  boasts some great supporting actors with Alec Baldwin as General Doolittle, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Dorie Miller, and Jon Voight doing a great job portraying President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Their roles could have been better had the movie not been crowded with a love story.A lot of work went into this movie.  When I went to see the film I brought a copy of PEARL HARBOR: THE MOVIE AND THE MOMENT to read while waiting for the film to begin.  After leafing through the book I expected much more from the film.  Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett fans will probably enjoy this film, but military history enthusiasts should snub it all together.\n",

The animation is amazing.  A quarter of the way through the movie you begin to forget that it's animated, then you are treated to a close up of Shrek and you can see everone of his PORES!  That's insane.  The story has a good message of not judging someone based on appearances, but looking inside them.  The performances are flawless and the theatre was laughing almost the entire time. Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy have such great chemistry together, and Donkey is one of the greatest characters.\n",

The animation is actually absolutely brilliant, it really looks more like a movie than a cartoon!I think some kids can watch this movie and enjoy the fairy tale aspect, but on the other hand, I think that some kids around 7 and 8 won't get, as one reviewer objected, some of the jokes, which are actually not targeted for that age, but more for a late teen and adult audience. I would not say the jokes are downright dirty, some have a double meaning but they are not vulgar or offensive and I don't see the need to get offended. I would not buy it specifically for a kid, but it is a movie that the whole family can watch together.\n",

This film is much, much better than any other action movie put out last year. It really makes every other film I saw last year look hollow and boring.Aspects of the film that I enjoyed were the uncertainty of which reality was being experienced at different times, the nature of the lead character's strong, yet easily-manipulated personality, and the many questions that are left up to the viewer to answer for him or herself. I believe the characteristic of this movie that is most engaging is the subtlety with which aspects of the plot unfold. Subtlety is in very short supply in modern movies, and I was happy to see that it played a very large part in Memento.The actors gave excellent performances. Solid, two-sides-to-each-decision roles that make you empathize with them, and yet sometimes you are reviled by them.The best film of the year last year, and I applaud them for making it.\n",

            "How you would describe this episode edition?\n",
            "Season 1 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is excellent, but I still do not consider it worthy of the title of \"one of the best Buffy seasons\" because it simply isn't. For a start there are a total of 12 episodes in Season 1 compared to the 22 in all the other Buffy seasons. Secondly, there isn't a lot of character development, most of which comes later on in the splendid Season 2. Thirdly, 20th Century Fox gave Joss Whedon a limited budget on which to film 12 episodes, making most episodes rather poor in sound quality, picture quality and special effects. Despite these few let-downs the season in terms of scripts, humour and character personality is absolutely excellent. Anyway, I'll get on with my review...Season 1 starts with a brilliant two-parter season opener in the form of Welcome To The Hellmouth and The Harvest. Both episodes were first broadcast on March 10th 1997 in the US to great critical acclaim. Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her mum Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) have moved from Los Angeles to Sunnydale, California. Buffy \"fell in with the wrong crowd\" and burned down the gym. What everyone doesn't know is that Buffy was trying to kill some vampires; she found out she was to be the Slayer before coming to Sunnydale. Figuring her Slaying days are far behind her, she hopes to make a fresh start at Sunnydale High School. On her first day, she makes friends with Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan) - a nerdy, unpopular, computer whizz-kid with a heart of gold and a personality to make anyone who encounters her turn to slush! She also meets Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) who is the best friend of Willow. She is also introduced to Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), who is kind to her on her first day at school. \"If you hang with me and mine, you'll be accepted in no time,\" she proudly states to Buffy. It's clear that Cordelia is obssessed with being popular and loved by everyone. But after Cordelia sees Buffy hanging around with Willow and Xander, she turns on her - spreading rumors about her that last up until the end of the season. Buffy also meets up with the school librarian, Mr Giles (Anthony Stewart-Head) who has secretly been sent to Sunnydale by the Watcher's Council in England to be the Watcher of a new Slayer. To Buffy, he's annoying - \"a textbook with arms.\" He knows Buffy is the Slayer, yet she won't accept this. \"Yeah, and I've both been there and done that and I'm moving on,\" she says. After Willow is snatched by a vampire, Buffy knows she must find her. Her Slayer instincts are instantly stirred and from then on, she realises being the Slayer is her duty. From then on, Buffy and the Scooby Gang (Willow/Xander/Giles) hunt the demons and vampires. Other top episodes include Witch, Teacher's Pet, The Pack, Angel, Nightmares and Out Of Mind, Out Of Sight. All the episodes have fantastic dialogue, witty one-liners and exciting storylines. This perfect combination is very hard to get right, but Buffy the Vampire Slayer manages to get it spot-on.The seasons' main story arc focuses on the vampire legend, as does the second season. Yet Seasons 3, 4, 5 and 6 didn't really focus on Big Bad's of the non-vampire variety. The Master (Mark Metcalf) is a very powerful vampire that is stuck in between Hell and Earth who is desperate to get free and rule over the world. He makes many attempts to get free in episodes such as The Harvest, Never Kill A Boy On The First Date among others. In the season opener, we meet Angel (David Boreanaz). For the first seven episodes he is know by the Scooby Gang as Mysterious Guy. He's never around through the day, has pale skin and seems to know a lot about vampires - some would say a little to much. In the episode Angel, Buffy finds out he's a vampire. The one guy she's had a crush on is a vampire. Angel is a vampire with a soul and hasn't killed a human for years since his soul was restored. Amazingly, the two start to see each other in Season 2 but for Season 1 they mainly work together with Willow, Xander and Giles. In the episode I, Robot...You Jane, we are introduced to Jenny Calendar. She is an I.T. teacher at Sunnydale High School and features in the season finale Prophecy Girl. In the fianle, the Master is freed from his prison between Hell and Earth. Buffy and the Scoobies spend the most of the season looking for where the Hellmouth is - they realise the Hellmouth is situated directly underneath the School Libary. So Buffy, Willow, Xander, Giles, Angel, Cordelia and Ms Calendar work together in a spectacular display of teamwork and determination to save the day...OVERALL GRADE: 10/10All in all, Season 1 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is essential for every fan. This TV show is legendary and these 12 episodes are absolute gems for everyone to treasure. The episodes are brilliant and you can watch them over and over again. A must buy - get your copy now from Amazon!\n",

            "Charlie's Angels is an insubstantial and entertaining dose of girl power. Although it will probably never be included in a list of 'alltime great films' it is nevertheless an enjoyable escape into a world where beautiful women kick-box their way out of danger, and manage to foil the bad guy's plans; all without smudging their makeup.Alex, Dylan and Natalie are an incredibly sexy crime-fighting trio, backed by an anonymous millionaire named Charlie. These Angels are the absolute epitome of cool. They can change from evening dress to street clothes in a matter of seconds, out-fight any number of evil henchmen, and disable a helicopter whilst hanging from the landing skids. And they manage to have a whole lot of laughs in the process; however if you're not a big fan of girlie giggles, this may start to grate after a while.The movie begins with a high-speed action sequence involving an attempted airplane hijacking which the Angels seemingly effortlessly manage to foil - this montage is perhaps emblematic of the rest of the film. The 'teamwork' motif is heavily emphasised, with the camera frequently (and occasionally annoyingly) cutting between the Angels whenever they're not in the same place at the same time. Visually stunning Matrix-style action sequences are peppered throughout the fast-paced script and these are well worth watching, even if only to marvel at how efficiently the fabulous trio of Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz dispatch with the baddies whilst wearing designer clothing and high heels.Charlie's Angels is not a movie that is likely to alter lives or provoke deep thought, but instead it can be enjoyed purely as fun escapism. And after all, isn't that what movies are supposed to be all about?\n",

            "\"Spider-Man\" as directed Sam Raimi, serves to prove that a movie can be greater than the sum of its parts.  There is no aspect of this movie that jumps out and makes the viewer gasp: the acting is solid, but not Oscar worthy, the special effects are more than serviceable, but not breathtaking, and the plot is entertaining, but not particularly complex.  However, when all of these elements are rolled in to one, you get a movie that is not just good, but great.  \"Spider-Man\" is a genuinely entertaining film that manages to avoid many of the pitfalls other comic book adaptations have encountered.  For example, it is my opinion that the X-Men movie took itself far too seriously, while conversely, the later Batman films weren't anywhere near serious enough.Driving this movie is the acting of its two main characters, Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, and Kirsten Dunst as his love interest, Mary Jane.  While some have argued that Maguire's performance was somewhat leaden, I thought it was perfect within the context of the movie.  Peter Parker is supposed to be withdrawn, a nerd really, and Maguire plays the role to perfection.  On the flip side, Dunst absolutely sparkles in her role.  Much has been made of her scenes wearing a tank-top in the pouring rain, and she is an undeniably beautiful woman.  However, she is also a very talented actor who conveys the full gamut of human emotion in her facial expressions.  I came into this movie not expecting much from her, and left very impressed.  The supporting cast is likewise solid, particularly William Dafoe in the role of the schizophrenic Green Goblin.  He deftly succeeds in turning what could have been a very cookie cutter villain into a surprisingly empathetic character.The story itself is relatively straightforward, and will be familiar to anyone who has even a passing knowledge of the Spider-Man comics.  That said, it was no less enjoyable for its predictability.  In particular, the early scenes, in which Peter is coming to grips with his newfound powers, contain just the right mix of humor and suspense.Finally, this DVD is loaded with special features.  While deleted scenes are noticeably absent, they are more than made up for by outtakes, commentary, making of footage, music videos and DVD-ROM content.  You definitely get a lot of bang for the buck with this two-disc set.Ultimately, \"Spider-Man\" accomplishes exactly what it set out to: entertain.  It isn't pretentious, or riddled with `inside' jokes, but it also doesn't descend into slapstick.  It contains the perfect mixture of action, humor and romance, and combines very good performances from the cast with solid special effects.  In conclusion, I guess the highest praise I can offer this movie is that I can't believe I have to wait another year for the sequel to come out!Enjoy!\n",

            "The third installment of Lord of the Rings trilogy have turned out to be a pretty exciting and entertaining film. However, the viewers might be divided in their opinions on how good the movie may be. For those who have not read the book, this movie will be their version of the One Ring that Rule them all. For those who have read the book, they may find it slightly disappointed at the choices Peter Jackson (director) made in the story. Now I have read the book I was slightly disappointed by some of the things Jackson did in the movie. (Did Gandalf forgot that he was a wizard?) All the stirring parts of the book was totally ignored but he did make other parts quite exciting and entertaining so I guess it even out. I can lived happily with Jackson's version outside of one part. I thought his treatment of Frodo and Sam was pretty shameful in the end. Here was two hobbits who basically saved Middle Earth from ultimate evil and there was little or almost no real acknowledgement from the Aragon or people of Gondor. Yes, they did all bend their knees to them in one scene but they also honor Pippin and Merry as well, equalizing Pippin and Merry with Frodo and Sam must be considered as an ultimate insult to the latter two hobbits. Jackson should had Frodo carrying the crown of Gondor to Aragon instead of Gimili and  he and Sam should had the higher honor then any other, since their was the most important of all the quests. Aragorn became King only due to Gandalf and Frodo/Sam's effort, they should be honored above all else. Only other major weakness as a film goes, it had to do with the end. Peter Jackson apparently lost his magic as he simply couldn't figured out how to end the movie. The ending dragged on and on and on like some endless poem that should have ended several verses ago. Those who will watch the movie will understand.Of course, I will be looking forward to the extended version of this movie on DVD since the story did suffered from point to point. Only then will there be a true classic in making.\n",

I saw the second one in the theatres, in was boiling hot, my Uncle was snorting continuously, the chairs were uncomfortable and the movie was just good enough, but not great enough to beat all the other unpleasentaries surrounding me. So, I come into this movie thinking it will just be like the rest of them, man, was I wrong. This is by far the best of three and the only one I would praise out of this trilogy. The ending is sad, yet happy and The WitchKing is the best bad guy yet. Plus, he can't help but love good old Gandolf. He makes his appearences in this movie much more notable then the first two, and even Frodo managed to get on my good side. This movie is terrific and if I were to go back and watch the first two now, I think it would be much more delightful and interesting. It's just a shame that they couldn't have made the first one like this because then I would have been fascinated from the beginning... and this is a great series to get in to because they have so much from this series. Overall, it's packed with excitement, good acting and a strong plot that builds throughout the trilogy. There is nothing more that I liked about this trilogy then the plot, the acting was always shaky in the first two, but they pull out of shaky and go to great in this one. Overall, it's a must see for anyone.\n",

A dream cast, literally flawless down to the smallest part, tells a tragic tale of loyalties betrayed and of bonds broken and bonds established.  Conrad Hall's cinematography is casually stunning and every production detail is  meticulous and authentic.  The past is captured with intelligence and care.Sam Mendes has found a way to tell this tale of violence and murder with great style and grace.  His choices throughout the film are brilliant, whether in unexpected closeups or thoughtful and unusual camera placement and angles. The use of weather (rain) and locale and the look & tone of the piece are marvelous. None of his work is forced and it flows and melds nicely.  With this, only his second film, he has established his place in the forefront of today's filmakers.  Truly remarkable work!I will not give the details of the story other than it involves Irish mobsters who are affiliated with Al Capone in Chicago, and how things go terribly wrong when a son discovers his father's (Tom Hanks) business. An aging mob boss (Paul Newman) must make the terrible choice between a baseless son and his adopted son whom he truly loves..  Their world is turned upside down and a quest for survival becomes a quest for redemption as well.As I said at the outset the cast is superb: Tom Hanks is completely believable in a different, darker role than we have seen him play before.  Paul Newman nails the contradictions in this charming but deadly old gangster.  Jude Law is spot-on as an amoral hitman.  And Daniel Craig makes an impression as the envious son with the constant smile but no laughter in his eyes.  Stanley Tucci does a nice small part and all the minor characters are fine.  But, the great work are the scenes between Newman & Hanks and Hanks and Hoechlin.

Last I checked WB was a recording company...  Man, if the show wasn't soooo good I'd return the discs.  Video is unsharp, overly high contrast in dark areas, and the sound is like an old stereo DVD mix (Like Highlander if you know what I mean).  I have a 36&quot; WEGA and audiophile quality sound system so its not that.  Oh well, Lana looks good on a black and white TV so I give points for that.  Hah.\n",

I'm biased because I LOVE musicals......but I believe that even those who normally don't like musicals will enjoy this, simply because of the unconvential way the song and dance numbers are presented.  Zeta-Jones, Zellweger, and Gere were BORN for this movie......I've NEVER liked Zellweger in anything I've seen her in until I saw this.  John C. Reilly's rendition of Mr. Cellophane is beautiful, and who knew he could sing like that? Oh, and what can you say about Gere's tap number?  You HAVE to see it to believe how good it is!!! Anyways, I won't go into plot details, there's no need to......but anyways, this movie is beautiful.  It's definitely a crowd pleaser, and for that reason, it definitely deserved the Best Picture Oscar.  I'm tired of stuffy, boring movies (The English Patient, or Il Postino, anyone? UGH) winning the Best Picture constantly, and it's about time that something fun and lively such as this took home the statue.  I highly recommend this movie!\n",

            "Revenge of the Sith is for children and for adults with the minds of children.  To a grownup, this movie is moronic and boring.The only good part of the movie is the very end when we see the birth of Princess Leia and her twin brother Luke Skywalker, and they are placed in foster homes because their mom is dead and their dad is the enemy.  The babies are cute, and you really can't lose by showing newborn babies.Aside from that, this movie is horrible.  The fight scenes are worse than kung fu flicks with idiots hopping around like bunnies.  The acting, particularly that of Anakin Skywalker, is really juvenile and pathetic.  The writing is worst of all.  The writing really deserves to be punished.  The screenwriter deserves a good whipping for this garbage.Anakin and Obiwan Kenobi are in another stupid fight, when suddenly Obiwan lands on higher ground and tells Anakin to give it up because it is hopeless since he is on higher ground.  Hahahaha.  What idiot thought of that?  They just needed an excuse to have Obiwan win the fight, so they made up that nonsense.  Does the public really buy that?  How many times in this same movie do people jump around from lower to higher ground and vice versa?  Oh my god is this a STUPID film.I knew it was going to be utterly stupid very early on, when the two jedi were about to enter an air battle in their planes, and one of them put a smile on his face and said This is where the fun starts.  In other words, as we well know, there is absolutely no doubt who will win, because at this stage of the movie the good guys win, and there isn't even any tension in a battle, it's just a ballgame.  Remove all realism from the script, why don't you.Another utterly stupid bit of writing, considering that this silly flick is targeted for children, is to have the only female in the cast die in childbirth.  Great.  Take your young daughters to see it.  They will have this to identify with and remember the rest of their lives.  When your target audience is young children, as the target is for this film because anyone who is not a baby will see how moronic it is, why do you want to scare the Bejesus out of the little girls in the theatre regarding having children of their own?It's a shame that instead of being punished for this garbage, the people responsible for this movie actually got paid for it.\n",

One day Nemo pushes his boundaries too far and is snatched up by a diver and put in a fish tank in a dentist's office. The rest of the movie is about Marlin trying to find Nemo and Nemo trying to escape.The animation in this film was stunning. At times, especially in the shipyard scenes, I actually forgot it wasn't a live action film that I was watching.The storyline is pretty humorous. Ellen DeGeneres is perfect as Dory, a fish who suffers from short-term memory loss. The scenes in the dentist office are also funny, even if they do make you not want to have your teeth cleaned anytime soon.Just a warning, even though the film is rated G, there are some moments that can traumatize young children, starting at the point early in the movie when Marlin loses his family. There are other scary moments along the way that may not be suitable for young children.\n",

            "I originally went to see this film most reluctantly. In fact, the only reason I went to see it at all was because my sister wanted to see it, and it was her birthday. So, how could I not? Well, am I ever glad I did! It was a most enjoyable experience. While the film is long, running nearly two and a half hours, it did not seem so, as it is a fun filled, action packed delight that is sure to entertain people of all ages.The story revolves around pirates with Johnny Depp in the role of Captain Jack Sparrow. He is a pirate who has lost his ship, The Black Pearl, to his arch enemy, the wily Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who led a mutiny against Sparrow. Unfortunately for Captain Barbossa, he and the mutineering crew commandeered some valuable booty that carried with it a curse that turned the ship and all aboard into a ghost ship, damned for all eternity, unless the booty is returned in its entirety to its rightful place. Therein, lies the tale.Captain Sparrow, desperate to recover his ship, ends up on an island where his antics bring him in contact with the Governor's beautiful daughter, Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley), and the local blacksmith, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who is in love with the delectable Ms. Swan. Before you know it, they all end up together in a rollicking adventure on the high seas.Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley turn in smart, top of the line performances, as does Jonathan Pryce, as the island Governor. Orlando Bloom also gives an excellent performance, though I found him decidedly unattractive in this film, thin lipped and sallow. It is Johnny Depp, however, who steals the show, a drolly funny and totally delightful scamp. Notwithstanding the fact that he has the best lines, Depp infuses the film with an infectiousness that is hard to resist. He literally makes the film.The special effects are spectacular and the film provides fun for the whole family, though given the special effects, it is probably wise to leave those who are five and under at home. Everyone else is sure to enjoy this fun filled, fast paced film. It has something for everyone with just enough action, romance, and humor to keep viewers entertained.\n",

            "How is this movie?\n",
            "This film is a blood fest delivered as a sly wink with Tarantino's tongue planted firmly in his cheek. He pays tribute to many films in this movie, particularly Honk Kong martial art films of the seventies. Like good rock and roll, the film explodes into action from the beginning and really doesn't let up until the last scene.One can see that he and the cast had a good time making this film, and the fight scenes are hilarious and way over the top. Revenge is the film's theme taken to extremes and Uma Thurman does a fine job seeming to capture exactly what Tarantino had in mind.There were moments in watching the film that I wanted to take it seriously, but as the blood gushed forth endlessly, this was difficult to do. Tarantino appears to have a compulsion about seventies kitsch; somehow intending to make the tasteless and outlandish move beyond hip. The movie is tasteless, ultra-violent, but violent in a comic book context. I suppose this is why the violence lost its impact, because it's meant to be fantasy, dreams of a pubescent boy.There is no depth to this film in terms of narrative because it is really all about imitation and form. This film is not about the story, but a rendering of style, delivery and surfaces that sparkle. It is advertising copy stretched into a feature film. And as all good advertising does, it will grab our attention, dazzle our base emotions, manipulating our sensibilities, turning us into impulsive shoppers.This film is very clever, but that's exactly the point. This is about the wonder boy, Tarantino, reinforcing his image as wonder boy filmmaker, proving again how clever he really is. It is cleverness for its own sake. However, if one goes beyond the tired pastiche, ad copy rendering, and seventies music, Kill Bill is a cheap thrill though good fun while you're watching it, but is easily forgotten as the last credit rolls.\n",

(The scene where all the patients are in the waiting room clutching onto their stuff was one of the funniest in the movie.) This movie is one that rapidly transitions back and forth in time. Kate Winslet's hair color was used as a clever way to help keep track of where we were in time, but for me it wasn't enough. That lack of orientation together with the rapid time shifts made me feel almost motion sick at times. It takes a huge amount of acting talent to play a depressed personality and be engaging. Jim Carrey who has an incredible range of emotion and facial expressions in his comedic roles was flat here. Pretty much the one look. I'd give this 3 1/2 stars.\n",

This emotional rollercoaster of a movie leaves you feeling sad, happy, thoughtful, cheerful, all at the same time. All of the acting (Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst, etc.) give excellent performances. Jim Carrey does a superb job as a quiet, boring, conventional human named Joel, quite unlike his normal performances. Kate Winslet also gives an enthralling performance as the exciting, spontaneous, wacky Clementine. The other minor characters are a bit underdeveloped, but the movie is quite enjoyable nonetheless. Catch this movie while it's still in theaters, it's not one you can easily forget! ENJOY!!!!!(...)\n",

            "What is the tone of the movie?\n",
            "I have to start by saying I'm fairly biased about this film.  The original was one of my favorite movies, and I grew up reading the comics religiously.  That being said, I do feel I would be able to give it an unbiased review if I didn't like it, but thankfully, that was not the case.Spider-Man 2 is Sam Raimi at his best.  I've never been in a theater where I've felt an audience have so much fun at a movie.  This film had everything: incredible special effects, great dialogue, romantic themes, plenty of action, and some decent acting.  When I first saw the trailer for the film, I thought the special effects looked a bit shoddy, but the final release was amazing.  Everything was seamless, and the attention to detail was very noticeable.  One of the best parts aspects of this film is the comedic elements.  I didn't expect to laugh going into Spider-Man 2, but it pleasantly surprised me and I found it more humorous than most comedies.  The humor is very subtle and some of it is campy, but doesn't come off poorly.  It's great watching Parker trying to deliver pizzas in his costume to meet a deadline, or being forced to use an elevator and make small talk with the other occupant.  Raimi fans will also be pleased with a few Evil Dead II references, and one 30 second scene in a hospital realy stood out and showcased his talent for the horror genre.Raimi captures the essence of Parker so much more closely in this film.  The Parker in this film is given a closer focus on the fact that he still experiences much of the flaws that every other New Yorker has to go through.  From having to live in a run down apartment, to never having any money.  Too many Super heroes come from wealthy backgrounds and have an unlimited supply of money, but Spider-Man is just a below-average teenager who's given an incredible ability. And this is why he's so identifiable and likeable to the audience.  As I said, Raimi does an incredible job of showing this and I couldn't believe how closely the film version of Parker matched the bumbling science nerd I grew up with in the comics.  In addition, comics fans will love this film for all of the hidden references that are stacked in the movie.  There's a cameo of creator Stan Lee, a photographic reference to a famous comic panel of Spidey taking of his mask, oft-quoted lines from the book, and Dr. Connors and John Jameson appear, who feature into the comic very prominently.It does have a few faults, albeit they're hard to notice.  I found that some of Maguire's lines came off a bit forced, which I noticed in the first film.  Franko is also a little stiff as Harry Osborne.  I didn't notice any bad acting, but nothing I would consider Academy-worthy either.  There was also a subplot about a physical problem with Parker that felt out of place in the film and wasn't developed very well.  But it made for some really incredible scenes that I wouldn't want removed.Overall, this is one of the best films I've seen in a long while, and accomplishes that rare feat of surpassing the original.  There were two or three specific events at the end of the movie that really blew me away and that I wasn't expecting, and will make for some very interesting sequels.  As a long-time Spider-Man fan, I can definitely say this movie is very fulfilling, and I would recommend it to audiences of any age and type.\n",

I have to admit, the director did push the envelope a little bit with the global warming/instant horrible weather slant, but I think that what he was after is to illustrate the point that everything we do effects us in some way.  Everything has a cause and effect.  I am not an environmentalist by far, but you have to appreciate Emmerich's approach in what he is trying to say in the film.  Bill Paxton gives a great performance too.  All in all, this is a mighty good flick!  Anytime you have massive tornadoes in L.A. and the Statue of Liberty flooded and then frozen, it has to be good!!!The only problem I had was that there weren't enough special features, hence, the four stars.

Links to the previous films are extremely tenuous, and generally very lazy (in earlier films incubation of the alien inside humans took a day or two, here it only takes 5 minutes). This film should have been so much darker, more brutal, in line with the comic books. Instead they sold out rather, by trying to appeal to the masses.That said there is one redeeming feature of this film - the fight scenes between the alien and the predator.

For those of us who grew up in the 80's/90's, this movie makes more sense. Yes, the humor is VERY dry and it is a slow movie (which I think makes it better).

            "\"Ray,\" Taylor Hackford's new movie based on the life of the great Ray Charles, is a strange blend.  I liked some aspects of this film very much.  Other parts gave me a bad case of the biopic blues.The flashbacks that depict Ray's childhood as a poor, fatherless boy living in Florida with his mother and his brother are wrenching and heartbreaking.  Sharon Warren, as Ray's mother Aretha, is a standout.  She is a formidable individual who rejects self-pity and never allows Ray to feel sorry for himself, even after he loses his sight.  CJ Sanders, as young Ray, has an incredibly expressive face that speaks volumes.  I also admired the beautiful Kerry Washington as Ray's long-suffering wife, Della Bea, a woman who stands by her man, although he betrays her time and time again.By now, most people know that Jamie Foxx will probably be Oscar nominated for his uncanny, dead-on performance as Ray Charles.  Foxx exhibits all of Charles's physical quirks and captures the nuances of his personality, including his unique musical genius, tremendous ambition, manipulative and predatory behavior towards the women in his life, and his self-destructive drug habit.  For every moment of this film, Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles.  Period.  The glorious music of Ray Charles permeates the film and I still can't get \"Hit the Road Jack\" out of my head.There were other portions of this film that irritated me.  Taylor Hackford bears much of the blame for some of the clunky and heavy-handed lines, and the absurd, over-the-top sequences that seem to spring straight out of a forties movie.  The worst of these are the \"Aha!\" moments when Charles suddenly gets an inspiration out of nowhere, and his producers all sit around grinning from ear to ear, agreeing that this is the sound that will make them all rich.  There is too much foreshadowing and melodrama, and the direction and cinematography sometimes lack the subtlety that would have made \"Ray\" a truly great movie.Still, you should see \"Ray\" for the three or four very fine performances and for the superb music.  These alone are worth the price of admission.\n",

            "Wow! How do you spell `Wow\" backwards? Sorry, that is an inside joke, a reference to my review of Christopher Nolan's \"Memento\", but an equally fitting reference to my feelings about Christopher Nolan's re-imagining of \"Batman Begins\".Ducard (Liam Neeson) waits for Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a jail cell, somewhere in Asia. He tells Wayne about a mysterious group of men he works with, who train to rid the world of evil. Arranging for his release, Ducard tells him how to find their camp. There, Wayne meets Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe, \"The Last Emperor\"), the leader of the League of Shadows, a group of highly trained men determined to make the world a safe place. Upon completion of his training, Wayne travels back to Gotham and finds the city in a state of decay. His former girlfriend, Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) is a District Attorney working to clean up the increasingly corrupt political system. She realizes that a psychiatrist, Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy, \"28 Days Later\"), is transferring all of a local crime lord's (Tom Wilkinson) henchmen into his custody at Arkum Asylum. Alfred (Michael Caine) welcomes Wayne back to his ancestral home, Wayne Manor. As Bruce announces his plans, Alfred becomes a confidant and assistant. Meeting Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), an inventor employed by Wayne Industries, Wayne begins to assemble the arsenal necessary for his transformation to Batman. As he begins to fight the evil in Gotham, he meets Sergeant Gordon (Gary Oldman), perhaps the last honest cop in Gotham.I am a big fan of the Tim Burton \"Batman\" films, especially the first one. But Christopher Nolan (\"Memento\", \"Insomnia\") has created a whole new vision of the character. I never really read a lot of superhero comic books as a kid. To me, the whole fun of watching the film versions is to witness the mythology of these characters. Some of the characters, like Batman, Superman and Spider Man, have been in our culture for so long they have reached the level of myth. Who doesn't know at least a little of the story of Superman's creation? Or Batman's? In \"Batman Begins\", Nolan creates a detailed, interesting, exciting film about the origins of Bruce Wayne and his superhero alter ego.Fitting a lot of information into the film, Nolan moves things along at a breakneck pace. A lot is going on, but it is easy to follow as well because the director uses words, actions, visual references and more to inform us. Isn't this what all directors should do? But how many are successful? This is a tribute solely to the writer and director. As we watch Wayne go through his training, Nolan inserts flashbacks to Wayne's childhood, giving us a glimpse of the fears that have so far shaped his life. The training includes a terrific sequence in which Wayne has to find a particular man, standing amongst identically dressed warriors, as the men move in unison, before fighting him. Upon his return to Wayne Manor, the other characters enter the picture and we learn about them. This is one of the best things about the film; there is so much going on. Just because the film is about a comic book superhero, Nolan didn't feel it necessary to dumb down the plot or the characters or make it simplistic. This is a film for young (well, not too young) and old alike.There is also a significant amount of humor peppered throughout the film. Wayne's relationships with Alfred (Caine) and Lucius (Freeman) create a lot of the humor, and warmth for that matter, in his life. In one scene, Alfred explains that Wayne needs to keep up appearances as a billionaire playboy, if he wants to divert attention from his alter ego. Therefore, he arrives at a party, in a flashy car, with two models sitting in the passenger seat. Alfred becomes less a butler and more a confidant to Wayne, more so than in any other incarnation of the story. And this works brilliantly, providing him with a sense of history, reason and grounding.The look of the film is also fantastic. Using real sets, for the most part, the action has a sense of urgency and place. Thankfully, they didn't use CGI to recreate everything, as they did in \"Star Wars Episode III\". It is my understanding that Chicago provided the backdrop for Gotham, with embellishments created by CGI. When you see it, you will understand why this is so important. Obviously, there is a significant amount of CGI work involved, but using a real backdrop gives the setting a quality that has been lacking in other films lately. All of this work helps to create the world these characters live in, making everything more believable. Because we believe Gotham really exists, the action, the danger and the story all are more believable.Christian Bale is a really good actor. One thing that can be said of all of his performances is that they are interesting. You might not like the character, or the film, but at least they were interesting. As Bruce Wayne, Bale brings a solemn air, an intensity that works. Wayne has some dark moments in his past and his upbringing and Bale is the right choice for this part. He is also able to inject humor and a lighthearted quality, at times, making the character three dimensional and interesting. When we experience a flashback of a traumatic event in his childhood, it is a very moving moment, because it brings us closer to Bale's portrayal of Wayne.Let's face it, the supporting cast is fantastic. Any movie that has Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Tom Wilkinson, Gary Oldman, Ken Watanabe, Rutger Hauer and Liam Neeson isn't going to be bad. And \"Begins\" is great, in large part due to the superb work of these actors, Cillian Murphy and even the future Mrs. Tom Cruise. The key to the success of all is that they are all playing the roles seriously. Yes, some of them have slightly humorous moments, but overall, they believe in these characters, their world, their actions. I know I sound like a broken record, but because they believe, we believe.Michael Caine, in particular, stands out. This, for me, was the most exciting casting choice in the film. The moment I learned that he had been cast to play Alfred, I was very excited. It is such perfect casting. In the role, Caine brings a layer of depth and conviction to the character we haven't seen before. Alfred has invested so much of his life in this family that he deeply cares about their legacy. This is a nice touch to the character and adds a certain amount of gravitas to the role.Cillian Murphy is also great as Dr. Jonathan Crane. Completely believable, he brings a real sense of menace, creating a memorable villain whose plan is very diabolical and multifaceted. Again, Nolan keeps what could be a complicated idea understandable, by revealing various aspects throughout the story. Murphy is also completely convincing as an American psychiatrist, even though he is Irish. There is no trace of his accent. Murphy has created a small handful of very good performances and appears to be poised to continue this streak.The story, as mentioned before, is very detailed. Towards the end, there are a few plot twists which surprised me. And I am almost never surprised by plot twists. They are developed well throughout and add a nice layer, creating additional suspense and intrigue.Nolan also manages to keep the film dark, much like Film Noir, without going too far over the edge. Gotham is drenched in shadow, the streets riddled with crime. The hero and the tone throughout are dark, but broken up by some great action scenes and light hearted humor. As the villain's plan begins to unfold, the story becomes darker and may be too intense for little children. For kids over a certain age, and adults, this just helps the film become that much more... you, know, believable.There are some terrific action sequences throughout the film. In a couple, as Batman fights the bad guys, the scenes are presented in a unique, almost impressionistic fashion. A glimpse of Batman rappelling down, a shot of thugs getting their heads knocked together, a brief look at another crook flying into the air with Batman. This is a unique idea. Generally, we see every fist hitting flesh, every cut, every ounce of blood spilling. In \"Begins\", a lot of the action is suggested to us, leaving our minds to sort out the actual details. This idea works really well.The film also has one of the coolest beginnings I have seen in a long time. Again, rather impressionistic, the opening credits suggest rather than inform.Generally, I can't stand the thought of a sequel. Can't anyone do anything original in Hollywood? They always have to rely on a sequel? \"Batman Begins\" was made because Warner Bros. wanted to reenergize the franchise. And Nolan has done that. At the end of the film, there is a brief coda setting up the inevitable sequel. In this case, Nolan suggests that there is so much more to be done with the story, the characters, the villains, that I welcome a sequel.Bring on the sequels, Mr. Nolan.\n",

            "This is the most satisfying of the Batman movies.  No goofy villains or campy lines here.  This Batman has a great script, plenty of action and terrific acting.Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freemen, Rutger Hauer and of course Christian Bale.  These guys are professionals.  Even though many of the parts seemed minor, each actor makes their presence felt.  They make this the most realistic of the Batman movies.High marks for the director, Tim Nolan who got these wonderful performances from these excellent actors.  He really had a handle on his movie and it shows.  He allowed his actors to  become multi-dimensional people, not simply side-kicks to Batman.  In a good \"period\" piece, the director develops his characters slowly; in some cases leaving the viewer to ponder if they are good or bad or somewhere in-between.  Nolan manages to create this struggle in his characters and at the same time keep the action level high.The plot is far more intricate than other Batman movies too;  taking it from a comic book action movie to an action mystery.  Gotham is dark and forboding and the Batman is tough and sober about his mission.Side note:  the chase scene is probably the best I have ever seen.\n",

            "At last, a movie worth watching, worth discussing & worth writing about.Batman Begins (Batman 5) is bigger, better & bolder than all its predecessors. The beauty of this one is that the focus is on Batman & not what the Riddler is doing or what prank the Joker is playing or what surprise the Penguin has in store.This movie is Batman all the way. The carefully selected Christian Bale is a wonderful choice for the Lead role the best Batman since Michael Keaton, he does justice to the role. He might seem a bit too young for the role of Bruce Wayne however we need to keep in mind that this is Batman \"Begins\" hence him being young.The entire movie was good actually it was great except for a few minor things. The Batmobile was a bit rugged as opposed to refined, the three main fight scenes (The one in jail, the one at the School & the last one) were really quick & you can't quite make heads or tales of it. Oh yeah, at the end of the movie the weather was probably cold but Christopher Nolan did not have to use Katie Holmes' assets to get the message across - on IMAX it is very evident - for those who have no clue what I am talking about, watch the movie & you decide.As for the cast; excellent choice, everyone of them. Caine is remarkable as Alfred, Neeson was outstanding in another one of his \"mentor\" roles - he might just get typecast if he keeps accepting such roles - Freeman is breathtaking as Fox, he doesn't have to say much, yet he owns the screen. Gary Oldman created a whole new him; a cross between Tom Skeritt & Edward James Almos plus a little extra. Katie Holmes, what can we say, she's all grown up now & can act too, good for her. She's got her life sorted out, she makes good movies & is dating Tom Cruise. Life is good. I do wish her the best though, she deserves it.Verdict: thoroughly enjoyable. A great movie for fans or moviegoers alike. Bale is great as Batman & is very convincing. Great movie, well made, well filmed & I am sure it'll be well liked as well.Rating: 4 &  stars.\n",

The movie is dark, action is heavy in places, but the writing was blah. The movie had a few flaws, but I still enjoyed the movie. People who dont like the movie are either iggorant people who write reviews to piss people off or they didnt like it because it didnt have enough action or have a short attention span and cant pay attention. First off, the acting was excellent, the action was great, and the movie didnt have a cheese factor like the other four movies do. I hope the trend of Batman movies are like this, and do not have Bale turning into a cheesy George Clooney type Batman.\n",

The story is very suspenseful, thrilling and full of action.  You will be on the edge of your seat the whole way through.The main problem that I have with this is that there are NO answers to any of the main puzzles in the first season.  There is a lot of background and the characters are developed with their back stories.  But, even as the characters' backgrounds are developed, we only find more puzzles with very few answers.  (I would say that there are no answers to any of the significant questions.)  For me, there are too many questions after 25 episodes.  I feel that my faithfulness in watching the show to the end paid off to nothing.Granted, as I stated in the beginning, I was entertained.

            "Sad to say, this is the first Steven Spielberg movie that I've come out of the theater feeling disappointed with. The trailer looked so promising that one logically assumed that the rest of the film would be just as good. Not the case here. This movie should have been titled \"Tom Cruise's relationship with his 2 children, with a minor subplot involving some alien spaceships trying to destroy mankind.\" But that wouldn't bring in the big bucks, now would it?This movie feels like a rough draft of a better, more cohesive movie. The best words I can think of to describe it are flat, uninspiring and oftentimes, downright dull. So much time is spent on Tom and Dakota hiding in basements that one actually forgets that this movie is about aliens attacking. And when the action finally gets going, we simply don't care. In fact one scene shows the alien tripods firing their weapons from a large distance away. How are we, the audience, supposed to get involved in it? And towards the end it shows the city of Boston demolished, and yet we never get to see it. We're only shown the aftermath. Another rip-off. The only worthwhile action sequence was the first one, when the aliens appear out of the ground and begin vaporizing people and cleaning house. This scene is worth the price of admission. If only the other action scenes were as good. Not that I'm one of those moviegoers who can only like a movie if it has non-stop action. I appreciate a good plot to go along with it. But \"War of the Worlds\" only offers a paper-thin plot.In terms of acting, no standout performances here. Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise...adequate, but nothing extraordinary. Dakota Fanning, whom I've liked in other movies, is simply annoying here. Most of her \"acting\" consists of screaming, crying, and staring bug-eyed into the camera. Tim Robbins steals the show although he is wasted. It makes me wonder what this movie would have been like if he had taken on the lead role.Oh yeah, and let's not forget about the cliches. Case in point, when Cruise is constantly able to walk away from disasters completely unharmed while almost everyone else is killed. The worst cliche for me came when the snake-like alien device was searching for humans in the basement. I was thinking to myself, \"any second now Dakota Fanning is going to knock over a tin can or make another mistake and cause the alien to turn back and look for them again.\" Sure enough, that's exactly what happened.I could go on but I won't. This movie was simply a let-down. It's the equivalent of seeing a nice tall cold glass of soda on a hot summer day, gulping it, only to discover that it's been sitting for days and is flat. But you can't spit it out since you've already swallowed it.If you must see a movie with a Cruise/Spielberg collaboration, watch \"Minority Report\" instead. While it has its flaws, it offers a much more compelling story.\n",

Don't take my word, rent or buy this movie (if you haven't already seen it).Back to \"Walk the Line\" - I saw Johnny Cash in a small venue about 15 years ago.

            "Not having been a fan of Johnny Cash my entire life, I didn't have any of his life details to compare while watching the movie.  I had no idea about his relationship with June Carter, or really any of his hit songs.  That being said, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.  The portrait that Joaquin Phoenix paints of the classic singer is a troubled man who battled some of the usual demons that people in the spotlight often fight.  Booze, drugs, cheating on the spouse, and losing touch with the loved ones in the family, all of these plague Cash in the film.  Most of these things, like always are self imposed, and should be avoided.  It's interesting how much these things affect the famous in the world.Anyway, the performances are solid, especially Reese Witherspoon, who shines in her role as June Carter.  She spends most of her life in the limelight, working with Cash for lots of her adult life and eventually marrying him.  The film provides us information about their life together once it ends with her agreeing to marry him.  Witherspoon won the best actress Oscar for the role, well deserved.  She is always watchable in her movies and this was no exception.In short, I liked the film.  Not a movie I plan on watching repeatedly, but it was worth the time to see.  I recommend it highly, even if like me, you know little or nothing about the singer.  This film is worth the time invested.\n",

I was born and raised christen even though I barley care about religion.  I gave this movie a chance to teach me something new.  This film is not very good at all.  The script is preachy.  The acting is decent, not great even though there is an amazing cast.  They all almost act like they are sleepy while doing their lines.  The story is full of holes, and sometimes it moves too fast and sometimes not fast enough to keep the audiences attention.  Visually it's not of epic proportions.  Let's just say its no Memoirs of a Geisha in the visual department.  The events themselves are almost silly at times.  For example Tom Hanks can do an anagram what might take most people days in a matter or seconds, and he just happens to know, well, everything there is about history.  Some characters are underdeveloped, like Tom Hanks character, while others have too much back story for their own good.  The movie as a whole though is very interesting and is not that hard to understand.  If you don't sweat the small stuff then the film is very entertaining and actually pretty good.  (*(*(*(*(SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!)*)*)*)*)  The films one biggest flaw is that it tries to stress that all sexes are equal, but in the end its all talk no action.  Audrey Tautou who is supposed to be the key is actually useless.  She does basically nothing.  She is supposed to know how everything works but she can't do the puzzles so she needs Tom Hanks, who is supposed to know nothing about all this, to do all of them for her.  Also they talk about how great it would be for a female to take over the church which I agree would be fantastic, but they just assume that the next heir to the thrown is a man.  This movie is a sexist attack on sexism.  But its heart is in the right place I guess.  (*(*(*(*(END OF SPOILER END OF SPOILER END OF SPOILER)*)*)*)*)  In all, this movie was pretty good.  It might be a good thing to watch it if you are open minded to other opinions.  Just don't go see it if you hate the idea that is tries to convey.

I always considered Iron Man second tier - a little bit like Green Lantern or the Flash.But this movie was great - it condensed 6 or 7 years of the comics into a single movie. That might be a problem long term but sure made for a exciting part 1.The plot was excellent and the CGI was VERY well done. The acting was super as well(especially Downey). My only beef was with Gwyneth Paltrow and that was a very minor one. Picture was top notch, sound was great and directing didn't get in the way of the story. Viewing this on a 50 inch LCD HD TV sure made for a great time. It's one of the movies we're going to show this summer on our outdoor 10 foot screen.This was nearly perfect - even the pacing was great. I would rate this a 9.5++ out of 10 stars.\n",

The moral choices along with Batmans personal struggles all draw you in.  The tone of the movie is dark and it hardly ever comes out of that even in the end but there is a little light.  I was never a big fan of Heath Ledger or his movies but I have to say I think now I am gonna miss him.  I really had no idea of how talented he really was until I got to the end of the movie and said \"Wow\".  Though he is not even recognizable I found the Joker to be one of the best played out characters of all time. I did notice that at certain moments though intentional or not when Batman was not Bruce Wayne he talked in this weird throaty voice which I guess might of been intentional but sounded weird.  The movie left me a lot of room to really think about Batmans struggle and the way he handles himself in those situations to either be a hero or slowly turn to being a villain.  The choices and decisions that are before Batman presented by the Joker are just so well played and so well thought out the eventual solutions Batman takes and the results all play nicely together.  I did like the fact this movie did not have a whole bunch of CG and everything revolved more around the human element and the reasoning of human nature.  Don't get me wrong CG is not bad but this movie had a lot more going for it than pretty effects.  I do wish Two Face had a bigger role and I figured when I heard certain phrases close to the beginning of the movie I figured they would repeat later as some sort of lesson or something.  I found the ending to be relatively weak and kinda came to a quick end after yet another moral choice brought by Two Face.  Though some parts I found predictable this is far by my favorite superhero movie of all time and to great to be missed.\n",

            "Does that movie have a good screenplay?\n",
            "They've nailed it. They've absolutely nailed it. My long-going, seemingly insurmountable level of anticipation (three years worth) has been shattered. I am just blown away by the brilliance of Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. Yes, masterpiece.The Nolan brothers and David Goyer created a story that is wonderfully complex and truly gripping. They drew pieces from some of the best parts of Batman classics like The Long Halloween, The Man Who Laughs, The Killing Joke, and surely many others (those are just what came to mind as I watched) and made something possibly even better. This isn't your usual throwaway piece of pop culture entertainment. It's much closer to art. The screenplay says so many intriguing things about humanity. Where is the proverbial line? How far can it be pushed to achieve what is ultimately a good and honorable goal? What is true heroism? When the chips are down, how will people react? These are the questions we're faced with. The Dark Knight doesn't presume to answer them for us, but it challenges us to discover the answers for ourselves. I've read several articles that go so far as to say that they think the film is being political, but I argue otherwise. I can't speak for the filmmakers, so maybe I'm wrong. However, the challenging topics of this film have been explored in countless Batman stories over a span of 70 years. These aren't new ideas to the Batman mythos. If anything, this just proves how relevant Batman continues to be, generation after generation.As for the film's technical aspects, let's talk about the guy most responsible for this film: Christopher Nolan. Can this guy make a bad film? Film by film, Nolan's been cementing himself as one of the great directors of our time. Memento, Batman Begins, The Prestige.... these are all amazing, top-tier films. And now, with The Dark Knight, I think everyone is going to finally realize just how good this guy is. And how about Wally Pfister's cinematography? Just gorgeous, gorgeous stuff. The score is very well done, too. It feels like a natural progression of the themes presented in Batman Begins. The new, much talked about one-note-based theme for The Joker works exceptionally well. And, of course, this wouldn't be a Batman film without some great action. Aerial stunts, car chases, explosions, and plenty of fight sequences.... The Dark Knight is a jolt of caffeine that keeps your heart racing from start to finish.While the action sequences and stunts are amazing, the more intimate scenes are the heart of the film. As a prime example, an interrogation scene between The Batman and The Joker honestly just shocked me. I figured their interaction would be good.... but it's much, much better than that. It's amazing to see such great character work in a blockbuster. And not only is it great character work, but the fabled complex relationship between Batman and The Joker is portrayed perfectly. At one point in the film, The Joker says this to Batman: \"You won't kill me, out of some misguided morality, and I won't kill you because you're just too much fun. I think we're destined to do this forever.\" Just perfect. Talk about a Batman fan's dream come true....One thing I don't think I can say enough about (and can't really do justice for anyway) is this interpretation of The Joker. After this performance, The Joker is definitely Ledger's. I can't imagine his take ever being topped. The Joker has always been one of the classic literary villains just aching for an accurate big-screen portrayal and man, Heath did it better than I could've ever hoped. He's somehow managed to pull off being funny, sadistic, charismatic, and downright frightening all at once. You can't take your eyes off the guy. And you can't decide whether you want to laugh or throw up when you hear his jokes. And often when he does make you laugh, you feel bad for doing so. That, my friends, is The Joker. And most importantly, this Joker is the perfect opposition for The Batman.... a true and constant threat that challenges him in nearly every way imaginable. Everyone's talking posthumous Oscar for Heath and I sure hope he not only gets nominated, but that he wins. This performance is just that good.I also really, really appreciate the other new central character: Aaron Eckhart's performance as Harvey Dent and Two-Face. Eckhart's Harvey is noble, yet cocky and angry enough before the accident to really sell it when Harvey is horribly injured and unleashes his darker side. I have to give some serious credit to the writers here, as well, for adapting the character so well. The tragic side of the character comes across perfectly. The rest of the performances are solid, too. I love the way Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman have elevated these films. These guys are some of the best we have and never seem to disappoint. Also, Maggie Gyllenhaal is a welcome addition to the cast replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Going in, I think I would've preferred Katie Holmes to stick around just for continuity sake, but Gyllenhaal does such a fine job that it's really not an issue.But who is this picture about? The Batman, of course, and they're continuing to get him absolutely right. Christian Bale is just an excellent Bruce Wayne. He's perfected the \"fake Bruce Wayne\" by acting like a silly rich drunkard, womanizer, and egomaniac. He's hilarious a lot of the time, but we never forget just how selfless of an act it really is. He also embodies the real Bruce Wayne which only Alfred and Rachel (and Fox to some degree) truly know. And last, but definitely not least, he's a heck of a Batman. In The Dark Knight, you can tell Batman is maturing. He's becoming the signature Batman who pushes the line of what's decent and acceptable. He walks the razor's edge every night. He's also becoming more self-sufficient. We see him doing more detective work. We see him making technological advances with little or no help from Lucius Fox. As for the title of the film: Batman truly becomes The Dark Knight in this story. The decisions he makes throughout the film show us this progression. And the decision he makes at the end of the film is one of the most refreshing takes on heroism and selflessness that I've ever seen put on film.I think it's safe to say that after this no one will ever look at the \"comic book genre\" the same again (if it's even fair to label this artistic vision as such). This is the father -- or The Godfather, as many critics have said -- of the genre. Look, I love Citizen Kane, Vertigo, Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, and The Godfather. Those are fantastic films that I could watch over and over again. But I'm going to go ahead and say it: this is the best film I've ever seen. Yes, probably all of those films (and many others) will always have a bigger impact on the history and future of filmmaking, but the quality of this film -- groundbreaking for the genre -- combined with my love of the Batman character and his world leave me completely unable to say otherwise. The film also, of course, dethrones the great Batman Begins as my favorite film of all-time. Begins did a magnificent job exploring the origins of the character, but along with its main theme, \"escalation,\" The Dark Knight just takes things to a whole new level. Finally, we've gotten the film that will almost certainly be met with unanimous agreement as the definitive take on the character. This is The Batman.... this is The Dark Knight.\n",

            "To be honest, when this movie first came out, I really didn't think too much of it. Didn't see it. Then, the great reviews and word of mouth came out. That changed everything. I have to say this people - I was pleasantly surprised. I think you all will too. The radiant Reese Witherspoon gets her first real big film playing Elle Woods, a blonde sorority girl who everybody assumes is just another ditzy blonde. After her piggish boyfriend dumps her because, as a law student, he needs somebody more like Jackie Kennedy on his arm. Not Marilyn Monroe. Elle, determined to prove people wrong about her, decides to go to Harvard to study in law and get her boyfriend back. She must of really loved him. Why would anyone want him back?. (...) Reese Witherspoon is a jewel. Plain and simple. She's as cute as a bug in a rug. She attacks the role with full force gusto and, in the process, gives a winning comedic performance that should win her a lot more faithful followers. She's teriffic. The jokes here are all pretty quick and funny. I laughed out loud a few times. I wasn't expecting it at all. It's a real great film for 'Girl Power'. It definitley has a nice message going. The movie isn't 'male bashing' as has been said. Please. Get over it people. The movie isn't obscenity laced(as stated by a review below). A few moments of the \"A\" word here and there, but that's it. Not what I call obscenity laced. What movie were they watching?!. The supporting cast is exceptional. The best being Jennifer Coolidge(American Pie 1 & 2, Best In Show), as a hairstylist that Elle befriends. Raquel Welch also pops up in a very brief cameo. The movie may be innocent fluff, but that's a good thing. Fluff is always a good thing. This is fluff that even male friends of mine have liked. Give this sweet movie a try. It was the nicest surprise of 2001 hands down. Reese, you are a star!.\n",

            "How is film?\n",
            "I fell asleep on this film a few years ago when I started it too late the night before it was due back at the video store.  It's not what I expected of a so-called \"cult\" film, or even a sci-fi or troubled-teenager genre flick.  Now, having some more time and patience, I gave this Director's Cut the careful attention it deserves, and the rewards are considerable.  The 26-year-old Kelly shoots movies like a pro if not an art movie director.  None of the \"shock editing\" that we've become so accustomed and desensitized to.  Instead, he favors long takes, slow pacing, and some of the most fluid camera movement in recent memory.  Moreover, he has a true artist's eye for shot composition, using the 2.5:1 anamorphic lens to maximum aesthetic and narrative effect in practically every frame.All the same, I've just ordered the earlier, shorter version to see if some of the apparent flaws I noticed in the Director's Cut are lessened.  For one, some of the scenes are overly formulaic and obvious--both in the scripting and filming.  The hypocritical, self-righteous characters are played quite loudly, bordering on flat caricature.  Moreover, Kelly pulls gratuitous tricks like mocking them with \"fast action\" shooting (whereas the youthful romantic hero and heroine, of course, are shot in slow motion).  Drew Barrymore seems to occupy unnecessary screen time toward the end of the film, tilting this POV film to her situation rather than Darko's.  Also, all the time-travel nonsense, which I understand has been exaggerated in both this version and on a Johnny Darko website, could be reduced to the betterment of the film, imo.  Still, the script is light years ahead of juvenilia time-wasters like Dazed and Confused (unless you're a teenager).Although Kelly talks about the film as Reagan-era social satire (an easy target, since the 80s were a rerun of the repressive 1950s), the movie is less about an historical period than about other movies: in fact, it's a collection of mirrors reflecting other movies.  Several shots of Darko recall Norman Bates, when we learn about his dual identity at the end of Psycho.  Darko's alter ego, Frank, recalls Jeffrey Beaumont's dark twin, Frank (Dennis Hopper), in Lynch's Blue Velvet.  The playing off of psychological vs. chronological time, challenging the viewer to decide which temporal dimension he is currently viewing, reprises Lynne's remarkable film, \"Jacob's Ladder.\"  And the time-travel theme owes less to \"Back to the Future\" than \"serious\" science fiction movies like \"12 Monkeys\" and the 30-minute influential French film classic by Chris Marker: \"La Jetee.\"But most strikingly, the film echoes the central theme of Burgess/Kubrick's \"Clockwork Orange,\" where Alex and his Droogs talk Nadsat and commit rape and violence to assert their free choice and humanity in a world that threatens to \"condition\" them, transforming them into deterministic machines.  Two key moments in Darko: the intercut chapter with the quote, \"The Manipulated Living will do anything to save themselves from oblivion,\" and Darko's conversation with his science teacher, who explains to him that if he were able to know his future, he would have a choice to accept or avoid it, which means that destiny would come to an end.This is a film that celebrates choice--not just its characters' but the viewers'.  Moviegoers need not subject themselves to mindless surrogate experiences in virtual reality, pretending that loneliness and fear are more imagined than real. The attentive viewer is likely to feel that the disturbed teen protagonist has made some significant choices which, however risky or even deadly, have prepared him to face the difficult circumstances of life that none of us can control.Finally, this is a director who definitely knows Catcher in the Rye, infusing his main character with so much of Holden's spirit (obsession with sex and death, impatience with phoniness and pretense, adoption of grandiose thinking and a savior complex) that Donny Darko becomes the \"everychild\" in each of us, more recognizable than we may be inclined to admit.\n",

And oh, MY, it's a bad film!!The Yoda fight scene DID rock, tho, yes, it did. (The only awesome part of the movie!)The script is bad, and we are left, again, wondering what this whole thing is about. I was so confused at the end of the first movie as to WHY there was all these battles, and what did it really matter in the end? Well, it doesn't really matter. That's what this movie showed us. These two films are totally disconnected in plot, except the personal strain going through them. (Maybe 3 will answer questions and loose ends, but I doubt it.) The acting was weak, and Anakin was more concerned with getting his way with Padme, rather than seeming genuinely in love with her. I realise that these two felt a passionate, carefree love in comparison with the more mature Han/Leia love, but the downright lust and danger of Anakin was annoying and disturbing. She wouldn't have gone for him. Her acting wasn't any better. And who wrote those lines for her? Talk about cheese!With a weak script and bad young actors (except, of course, Chris Lee and Frank Oz, and Ian McDiarmid) Lucas has succeeded in showing the world that movies cannot ride on CGI and fame of a name alone. Well, he'd like to think so, wouldn't he?None of the spark and substance of the original, though we're closer to it than the first movie.\n",

            "This film is just right, like the warm cup of tea on a cold night, or the first sunny day after weeks of rain. I own the DVD and have seen it several times, and each time it fills me with a kind of wonder. It is the kind of timeless and pure story that made Hollywood great, but that Hollywood doesn't make any more.Aside from a handful of cynics, I can't imagine anyone who won't enjoy Amelie. But here's a test: if you, like the films main character, can take joy from life's simple pleasures (like the way your hand feels sinking into a sack of dried beans, the way street markets sound and smell, the absurdity of a horse running with the Tour de France), then this is a simple pleasure you don't want to miss.As far as the quality and value of this film, I can't add much to the hundreds of reviews already posted here except to say \"Yes! Yes! Me too!\"An interesting side note: the more I watch the film, the more little cultural references and word plays I catch. I'm sure the film is full of them, but I think it would take a native French speaker or long-time Paris resident to catch them all (understanding them is not necessary to enjoy the film; they're a bonus).One I caught on the most recent viewing on TV (my French is sketchy, but seeing it with Italian subtitles rather than the English helped) is a play on words by Hippolito, the failed writer in the cafe, who comments that the cafe's regulars speak about the weather out of fear of the passing time. In French, \"temps\" means both \"time\" and \"weather.\"Similarly, the grocer Collignon tells Amelie to contact his mother to discover the name of her apartment's former tennent. He says, \"Elle a une memoire d'elephant, un elephant de mer.\" That translates to \"She has a memory like an elephant, a sea elephant\" -- a reference to a manatee or an seal. But the point is the way Collignon stresses \"mer\" (which means \"ocean\"), which sounds the same as \"mere\" (which means \"mother\").I also noticed that the voice over used when Amelie imagines the television retrospective of her life is from the same person who does the television commentary for the funerals of France's rich, famous, and powerful. I peaked at the credits and found that he is Frederic Mitterrand, the nephew of the late prime minister.The last might be a stretch, but on my last trip to Paris I noticed a old-time chocolate brand called \"Poulain\", which is Amelie's family name. Maybe that's just a coincidence, but with a film as sweet as this one, assuming they come from the same source is an easy mistake to make.\n",

            "Boy we are very critical of this film aren't we?Since when has Hollywood ever followed the plot in a book?  I know of only one film where they even remotely followed the book's plot so the fact that the Queen of the Dammed didn't even begin to follow the storyline of Anne's Rice's book should not surprise anyone in the whole wide world!Okay, with that cleared up I have to say I liked the film!  I liked all the actors; they were a credit to the roles they played with Stuart Townsend coming across very well as the tormented yet truculent vampire Lestat and David Talbot played by Paul McGann was really good as the man uneasy in the presence of vampires but drawn to them all the same.The Queen of the Damned is play by the late singer Aaliyah and I was surprised at how good she was, I wasn't expecting much but she did the role credit despite what other critics have said and I liked the idea of a Vampire becoming a rock superstar whose links to the Queen of the Damned are through his music and his drinking of her blood, a novel idea in my opinion.Akasha the Queen of the Damned is the mother of all Vampires, she knows no restraint, she will drink the world dry of mortal and immortal blood, she is sensual, she is a demon, she is blood lust all rolled into one violent and burning package and Lestat has awakened her and she wants to turn the world into her own little feast fest but she wants a King at her side and Lestat is going to be that King.Bring into the world of the Vampire and mortals Jesse played by the able actress Marguerite Moreau whose ties to the Vampire world is through an ancestor who before being made had born a child, and had watched over that child's descendents through the ages, add to that other Vampires, cruel, sensual, wicked, avaricious but occasionally compassionate and you have a heady tale of love, lust, desire, music and lashings of blood and pain.Good special effects, and a great sound track, all in all a great little horror flick that works well on the small screen!I quite liked the scene in the film when Jesse offers David immortality, she is now a Vampire herself and Lestat's consort but David hurriedly refuses, he likes his mortal ties.  However the Vampire Marius who made Lestat, played wonderfully by the delicious Vincent Perez has other ideas, Lestat is now with Jesse and Marius has his eye on David.  The film ends with Marius going into the library where David is alone and we know he is going to force David to become a Vampire!  A wonderfully ironic ending if there ever was one.My only regret is I didn't see this film on the big screen but it transfer to DVD quite well and it is a very enjoyable watch for those who love Vampire stories with more throat than gore.\n",

From the very first moments of the pilot, I was hooked.  The opening theme music is one of the best ever composed for a television series, and the opening credits are fascinating -- so much so that there's a featurette on the DVD just about the making of the opening credit sequence.Then there are the characters.  These are not two-dimensional sitcom charicatures; they are very rounded, deep, complicated people.  They actually seem like real people (and a LOT like my own family).Add the acting to that -- what a great cast!  Every single principal actor on this show is terrific.  As an ensemble, they equal more than the sum of their parts.That writing!  These are well-crafted episodes.  Each episode tells a couple of self-contained stories, but there's some serialism going on, too, which keeps you coming back for more.And direction... very fresh and stylized, not the standard TV dramedy fare.I'm gushing, I know.

OK, Nate and Brenda's constant cycle of blowing up and making up gets a little tiring, but that's really the only complaint that I have (other than the fact that Season 2 doesn't have a release date yet).\n",

As such, I've been able to see so much more than having to have waited for a year to enjoy them all.  This show has had so many little things that added up from previous seasons.  The characters have grown and changed, the cast has grown with it.  The stories have gotten better, and more interesting.  All of which led to the last episode...the begining of the dominion war.  I was thrilled.  Sisko has come into his own as captain.  All the characters are now more and more interesting.  The supporting characters are great, and frankly this show is one of the best science fiction shows around.  I regret treating this show like the middle child it seemed to be.  Left after the next generation, but not allowed to become the flagship show  (that was left to voyager), constantly having to fight off other sci-fi competitors (babylon 5), this show was always given the raw end of the stick.  But the show didn't seem to care.  Every season has improved, and rather than copy what others had done, this show stayed the course it always intended.  Having watched this show from the begining, you can tell the intent for the dominion war from as soon as season 2.  This show could have played off old star trek cliche's, but instead chose to be its own, for better or worse.  Try this show.  I ignored it for far to long and missed out on some of the best science fiction had to offer.\n",

            "The third season of Family Guy is unfortunately the last, but knowing it was bound to get cancelled, Macfarlane just made it absurd.  He really pushes the envelope and makes some completely hysterical episodes.  Ironically, the episode that got banned from Fox isn't nearly as controversial as some of the ones that did make it on.I cannot stress how funny the show was.  The cutaways make it what it is.  Peter soiling himself at the dinner table was one of the most random and crazy moments of the show, but still absolutely priceless.  The fan request episodes are totally out there, but they still are priceless.  And Death going on a date...PRICELESS!Do yourself a favor...get the DVD set and Season 1/2 and watch this on Cartoon Network or whatever you gotta do to see it!\n",

            "It's kind of hard to put down a movie like this because it is such a sincere effort, and because the historical events depicted are so rarely treated in film for contemporary audiences and are so intrinsically intersting. It is, sad, though, to see so many chances missed in a single film.Stonewall Jackson (the overriding subject of this film) is probably the most interesting American Military leader in our nation's history and deserves a film at least of the caliber of Patton; yet in this film so little is really revealed about him, other than that he is devoutly religious, loves his wife, enjoys the company of children and wins a lot of battles. More focus, better casting, and less attempted breadth of scope would have produced a more biographical film to be much more valued and enduring. The strangest irony of all is that the perfect actor to portray Jackson in such a biograpy was already in the film, cast as Lee. (The fact that Duval was so disappointing as Lee only adds to this irony.)The greatest disappointment, however, was the portrayal of the battle of Chancellorsville, which was so hurried that it only occupied about 20 minutes of film time. Chancellorsville was in fact the most significant, greatest and longest day of Jackson's life (probably also the greatest single day for the confederacy) perfect for him in every way, including, perhaps, the fact that it also happened to be his last day in charge of his army. Such an end for him, mortally wounded by his own soldiers at the close of his greatest victory, seems almost too perfect not to be scripted. So many wonderful details about this battle were missed, such as the fact that the union soldiers, who were cooking breakfast, were first surprised by deer and other animals bounding from the forest in the path of so many confederates moving rapidly toward them through the woods. To a film which paid so much attention to historical detail, this sort of detail would have added much to the proper mood and the almost mystical qualities of the battle.The worst thing about this film, however, besides the cameo appearance by Ted, which was certainly the low point, was the really sappy music, which intruded frequently on dialog, unnecessarily distracting and annoying any earnest viewer who might still be trying to concentrate on the actors.The film is not entirely bad, however, and does provide at least a cursory view of the early stages of the civil war, and does provide well intended attention to historical detail, setting and costume.\n",

            "Firefly is like no other television program.  Only lasting one year, with episodes randomly thrown on strange nights on FOX, this series boasted a classic combination of science fiction with a western flair.  How could it go wrong?  A humorous program that had fun, fought bad guys, and harbored extremely dark secrets.  Why did it only last one season?  Marketing.  FOX, as we all can learn from my review of Outfoxed, is not quite the \"fair and balanced\" type of programming that it promotes, but instead attaches itself to the hottest trend and pushes it nearly to the point of sickness.  For those that would disagree, I ask you to check out how many predictable seasons of American Idol we will have to endure until someone realizes that it lost its steam a many a moon ago.  Or how about the disaster of a series called Wife Swap?  Honestly, did FOX just ignore the idea of creativity and push directly for insulting \"reality\" television?  From what I see on television today, I could only assume the answer to be \"yes\".  Firefly was a bold, unique, and highly original series that gave us powerful characters, detailed stories, and that Lost itch in the back of your mind that keeps you asking that age old question, \"why\".  Yet, in all of its power, it was cancelled.Firefly is perfection on a stick.  The twang of the guitar, the stone-face stare of Mal, the goofiness of Jayne (is that a girls name?), the questionable past of Shepard Book, the humor of Wash, the power of Zoe, and the innocence of Kaylee is exactly why I fell in love with this show.  This is honestly, one of the few series that I could go back from the beginning and watch again, loving every moment of it.  Whedon created a masterpiece in my eyes, and a huge opportunity was missed by several major networks to keep this imagination alive.While some will argue that Firefly was full of nothing more than C-rated actors who were \"shallow cut-outs, and whose dialogue never rises above the level of a so-so sitcom\", I thought that they brought so much personality and charisma to a smorgasbord of unoriginal programming. I wanted to know the truth behind River and the darkness behind the good Shepard.  I continually waited for a snappy comeback from Mal, and was excited whenever he showed humility.  Jayne was a big favorite of mine, always questioning authority, yet as loyal as the family dog.  The love between Zoe and Wash brought a new layer of honesty to this sci-fi series.  It wasn't just about paying for the ship, flying through unmapped terrain, or stealing, it was about humanity.  That sense of humanity could be found in the opening episode for this series aptly titled \"Serenity\".  In it, the crew takes upon some passengers with some rather unknown cargo.  Inside one of those crates is a girl that will change their lives forever.  For this series to work successfully, as it did, we needed human characters that bled, felt compassion, and demonstrated connectiveness to each of us.  Mal's ship, Serenity, was a living example of how television could be done creatively and originally.The characters could only be as strong as the words that were handed to them.  Listening to the words that pass through Mal's mouth, the charm of Wash, or even the inconsistent ramblings of River, you could only wonder where Whedon could have gone with all of them.  In each of these characters, Whedon had written secrets.  While, sadly, we may never know what they all were, that is what made you itch for more episodes.  You not only wanted to see the creative \"western\" adventures that Whedon was sending his crew, but you also wanted to learn more about these band of renegades.  They were good, but possibly darkness reigned inside of them.  The character most guilty of this (outside of River) was Shepard Book.  I loved this character.  Whedon drew him with so much passion and conviction, yet with every episode you learned more about this man than imaginable.  He is an excellent example of what this series was like.  He represented the smart words of Whedon, the humanity of his character, and the secrets that each of these shared.  He was a \"priest\", yet he knew more about the Alliance than anyone aboard that ship.  If anyone were to ask me to describe the series in two words, I would simply say, \"Shepard Book\".George Lucas is credited with creating this detailed futuristic world that gives us glimpses of a possible future, or a galaxy far far away, Whedon succeeded in this series by giving us a plausible future in the not-too-distant future of 500 years.  Prostitution in legal, in fact respected in the community, the Chinese and Americans have forged one super power called the Alliance, and our hero is a war veteran, still not shaken by the loss that his side took due to the Alliance control.  While Lucas gives us far-fetched characters and situations, Whedon gives us a imaginative look at our future.  I think that is why this series worked so well for me.  I could imagine this future.  I could see it past the characters.  I wasn't bogged down by dopey looking aliens, but instead a plausible man vs. man situation.  Firefly was simple, yet so complex.I could honestly go on forever about how much I enjoyed this show.  I have never watched a series where I found myself prepared to watch over and over again. Firefly blends a power mixture of comedy, western, and action all together ... and the characters bleed.  Villains die in this series.  How often do you see that?  If you have not watched this series, or have not spent the money to support it, DO IT RIGHT NOW!Grade: (proudly) ***** out of *****\n",

            "I had never heard of this show until it showed up as a suggestion on Amazon Prime.  I read a few reviews and saw that it was a precursor series to the movie &#34;Serenity.&#34;  I did see that movie and really enjoyed it.  After watching about half of the episodes I am just blown away by how wonderful this series is.  I am quite sad that there is only one season.  While a part of me cannot understand why it was cancelled, another part understands more clearly.  Mainstream television viewers are not interested in a show of this quality.  It has too many elements that poor imaginations cannot wrap around...and poor imaginations are a plenty in the living rooms of America.  People dressed like cowboys flying around in spaceships?  We all know that, in the future, we will all be wearing tight fitting uniforms issued by the interstellar government.  Everything will be clean and shiny.  There will be a problem and our heroes will solve it using nothing but intellect.  We can't possibly be so base, in the future, as to punch people out in a matter of principle.Firefly is a refreshing, imaginative look at the future.  The characters are complex and flawed.  The spaceship is dirty.  It is gritty and realistic, which makes the characters and the worlds encountered much more believable and accessible.  I would trade just about everything on television these days, especially all of the &#34;un&#34;reality shows for more seasons of Firefly.  It makes me sad that, just when something truly entertaining comes along, it is tossed in the garbage heap in favor of another police drama or reality show about idiots running around a swamp somewhere carrying guns.Well, at least I found this absolute gem of a show and had one fantastic season to watch.  Hopefully, someone will come along and try to bring it back to life...it's been done with much lesser shows!\n",

But if you're talking about video quality in the editing department, the GRACE UNDER PRESSURE concert video is still the best.For all you video editors out there who are reading this: PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE FAST JUMPING AROUND WITH THE CAMERAS EVERY HALF SECOND! Why are so many concert videos and dvd being filmed that way nowadays?! Look at Iron Maiden's Rock in Rio. That's a great band with a great performance, but the video editing is pure crap! I can't even watch that one. Rush In Rio isn't quite as bad as the Iron Maiden one, though. The camera shots jump around too fast mostly in the first half. Especially during the first 2 or 3 songs. Then it becomes a little less annoying in the 2nd half. Lately I've been starting with One Little Victory and watching it from there just because the camera work is too annoying during much of the first half.I think they should recall this dvd, then let ME come in and do the video editing and I'd make the video portion of the dvd perfect. And I'd do it for free!The sound has some minor flaws, but it's hard to tell on my tv because I don't have it hooked up to my stereo, so I can't give an accurate stereo quality review.There's a lot of energy from the audience which may annoy some people. For some reason, Brazilians like to yell and chant a lot. The energy from the band is amazing. Their performance is what really makes this dvd worth buying. Great song selection, too. At least one song from every album except Caress Of Steel and Hold Your Fire.Despite the annoying MTV style camera work and a sound quality that could have been better, this dvd is worth it.\n",

Nor does the heart-throb image of Tom Cruise.Yes, Cruise's name sold the movie. However, his acting also carried it. Of all the films I have watched this year (and I have seen most of the Oscar contenders), this was the first time I actually thought to myself \"Wow. This guy is good.\" Tom Cruise is amazing in this film, as are the rest of the cast, most outstandingly Watanabe (Katsumoto) and Koyuki (Taka).To summarize: Cruise plays a post-civil war soldier who is hired by the Japenese Emperor as a battle advisor against the rebellions of the last remaining samurai. However, the American is taken hostage by the Samurai during a battle and soon befriends the Samurai village. The Last Samurai is a story of love, spirit, and, most of all, a sacred honor which guides us all.The battle scenes, while gruesome (if you're squeamish, you might avoid this one), were amazing. The cinematography is wonderful. However, the actors, the themes, and the BREATHTAKING score carry the film to a superb quality deserving of the highest recognition.Deep down, it is a feel good movie. Despite the death, the sadness, the lost hope, one ultimately cannot help but smile for the beauty of mankind.Never judge a book by its cover.\n",

Star Trek made a huge impression on me growing up on a farm in the midwest.  It started my love for techlogy and computers.  I believe it's a big reason I'm in the computer industry today.Well getting on to the review.  I recently picked up a PS3 to use as a blu ray player and gaming console.  My first TV episode blu ray purchase was Star Trek:  The Original Series - Season 1.  On a big screen TV these episodes look simply amazing.  I have an Apple TV and have downloaded the remastered episodes from Apple and these look noticably better to me.  Like other reviewers said, the colors and picture quality is amazing.  I started out with one of my favorite episodes \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\".  This looks better than any movie I've seen from the 60's and 70's.  It's a great but tragic story too.  Sally Kellerman and Gary Lockwood are excellent guest stars.  I wish they would have figured out a way to bring them back in other episodes or movies.The Billy Blackburn home movies are a hoot.  It's really great to see the behind the scenes stuff.  You'll notice that Leonard Nimoy is deadly serious most of the time even when off camera.  Blackburn says he rarely got out of character.  Plus there is some other surprises with Blackburn that I won't spoil.If you're a SciFi lover or just a lover of good writing and television.  I would add this to your collection without hesitation.  I hope they do a similiar restoration to the \"Twilight Zone\" series and \"The Next Generation\".\n",

            "It's hard to believe that the company that made this incredible film; Constantin Film; also made the excellent Resident Evil films and the not-so-great Fantastic Four movies (bleh). This war movie is absolutely fantastic and well-deserving of the many awards and critical acclaim it received.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The year is 1945, and the Russians are closing in on Germany and the Third Reich. So the main leaders of the Third Reich; Adolph Hitler, Eva Braun, Joseph Goebbel along with his wife and children, and various employees and military leaders hide in a bunker to avoid capture from the Russians. The story is basically told from the point of view from Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge, who was in the bunker during the last days of the war and a witness to the downfall of the Third Reich and escaping from the Russians.MUSIC: There's not much unfortunately, that's what makes this movie flawed.STORYLINE: This story is well told about these historical events and is beautifully and masterfully carried out.ENTERTAINMENT: This film is brilliant, and near-perfection. This is one of those movies you have to have real taste for, otherwise you might get bored. It definitely isn't for kids. What makes this film all the more authentic is that the film is in German giving the already amazing feel another injection of compelling drama. This is one of the best war dramas (and dramas in general) ever made, it's compelling, the acting is great, it feels very real, and it is a masterpiece.OVERALL: You're not going to find a whole lot of foreign films this great, or for that matter, great films in particular (Hollywood really sucks these days; there is virtually nothing good to speak of). Watch this movie, you owe it to your movie-loving self to watch one of the best dramas, best war movies, best foreign movies, and one of the best movies to come out in years. This is not my favorite movie, but this is one of the more better quality films I've watched in a while amid the many stinkers I've watched.THE GOOD: Great story, great actors, feels authentic, it's brilliant, and it's just a flatout masterpiece.THE BAD: Very little music.\n",

Night Shyamalan's crap-fest, &quot;The Village&quot;An abortion of a film, &quot;The Village&quot; is the ripoff movie of 2004 with &quot;Van Helsing&quot; right next to it. These 2 films are playing in every multiplex in hell along with &quot;Signs&quot;, & &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot;, with a complimentary helping of &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; thrown in for good measure (now THAT'S scary!). &quot;The Village&quot; is a scary movie that is made for women (its the type of scary movie that won't induce nightmares. In other words, its NOT scary) & looks like it was filmed on location at the local &quot;Pottery Barn&quot;.&quot;Covington Woods&quot; is home to a small village of peaceful people who have a small problem. They can't leave their village due to &quot;creatures&quot; living in the woods that surround the boundaries beyond the village. When the villagers first settled down into their new home, they made a pact with the &quot;creatures&quot; along the lines of, you leave us alone, we will leave you alone. &quot;The creatures&quot; have other ideas sneaking into the village at night leaving behind dead, mangled, & hairless chihuahuas about the grounds & scaring the villagers witless. When a stabbing occurs, that could prove fatal if not without the proper medication, a young blind girl, who isn't afraid of &quot;the creatures&quot;, is sent to the village across the way to get the proper medication that can heal her future husband.As I watched &quot;The Village&quot;, with roughly 30 other people in the theater, I couldn't believe how bad this film was. The only comedy relief that came throughout the film was when one of my fellow moviegoers promptly stood up during a slow point in the film, declared that this movie, quote - unquote, blows, and then left the theater. What suprised me was that not one of the 29 other people, myself included, didn't disagree with him!The movie is a bit of a bore. I do give credit for some great cinematography but thats it. The cast is lame. Everyone walks thru their roles. Sigourney Weaver is wasted in her role (I was waiting for her to cowboy up, slap her idiot son in the back of the head, and go kill &quot;the creatures&quot; herself). William Hurt reads his lines as if their on cue cards. Joaquin Phoenix looks like he's on some bad valium trip (his character is reminiscent of the Mel Gibson character from &quot;Signs&quot;. Phoenix even looks like a bit like Gibson in some shots).&quot;The creature&quot; is absolutely laughable, being a cross between a pig, & a porcupine with a red riding hood complex (Frank, the bunny from &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, is more scarier, for God's Sake!). I would be more scared if a car full of clowns showed up in the middle of the woods, than this &quot;creature&quot; chasing me.The so called &quot;gotcha&quot; surprise that happens in every one of Shyamalan's films usually suck. This one is no surprise (when the surprise is revealed, I couldn't help but think if these people missed watching the Democratic Convention and hugging a tree everyday. Maybe they still hug trees, but their was no hugging of trees on screen).Shyamalan's main downfall is that he always has the sense & style to create a suspenseful film but when it comes to the payoff, or the moneyshot he can never deliver (&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is the golden exception). Also, the main problem with Shyamalan's film is, after the release of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; & with every Shyamalan film there after, audiences know something is going to happen during the final act of the film, so they keep their eyes open for every little detail available thruout the course of the film.&quot;Time&quot; magazine was once quoted as saying that M. Night Shyamalan is the next Steven Spielberg. No way in Hell, buddy. No way. Not even with a Ford Focus full of clowns.\n",

            "How is the music?\n",
            "There is a legend surrounding the old opera house in Paris.  The story goes that some creature lives downstairs demanding things of its owner.  They must pay him rent and star his protegee, Christine.  But as the Phantom is finally showing himself to Christine, she is falling for another man.  And the new owners think they don't have to listen to the Phantom.  These events will force the Phantom to take action and his true nature to be seen by all.I've only seen the stage play once, so I went into this movie with very little expectations and no baggage.  I was very impressed.  There is a jaw dropping scene as we first move from the \"modern\" era black and white to the color setting of the story.  The costumes and sets are fantastic, bring the story to life in a way not possible on stage.  Yes, events from the play occur in different orders, but over all, the story is still preserved.  The music, including the new song, is still outstanding.So what's my complaint?  It's the same one I have with the stage version.  The Phantom is made out to be sympathetic.  This is even truer here as we see his past as a little boy.  The problem is he's an evil man whose true nature comes out the more people stand up to him.  I realize I'm alone in not enjoying this glorification.  At least he does realize how bad his behavior has been near the end.Overall, this is a wonderful musical brought to life beautifully on screen.  Stage purists won't like it, but the rest of us will be able to enjoy this outstanding musical.\n",

            "How about voice?\n",
            "For the record, my screen name is a reference to the stage play, and will remain that way, although I was happily impressed with almost everything about this movie.I have never been a particular fan of Sarah Brightman, whose voice is a little too thick and contrived for the young, pure soul of Christine.  Emmy Rossum, on the other hand, is absolutely perfect.  She was born to play this role, and it will follow her the rest of her life.  Not a bad thing.  I wish she had been playing the lead the last time I saw Phantom on stage.Patrick Wilson has a nice voice, and he was good enough in the role of Raoul, which is a fairly flat role to begin with.  However, the role can be played with greatness, and I would have liked to see the Broadway Raoul Jim Weitzer in this role, for he is fantastic.  I saw him when he was merely an understudy on the traveling tour, and he gives his Raoul life beyond the script.  Oh, well.  It's Christine's story, and Wilson is likeable enough to be believed.The music, with one exception, is spectacular, actually an improvement over the original 80's score.  The orchestrations are bigger and the sound is more modern, and yet perfectly authentic to the original.The story, with one exception, is almost word-for-word the same as the stage play, and being without the restraints of the stage leaves the filmmakers able to cut between scenes and do things a play simply can't do.  Visually the film is beautiful, full of the bright colors and glorious eye candy that those who have seen the play will expect.  There was even a moment during the opening scene, when the chandelier rose and the color splashed onto the screen and that magnificent score began, when I almost felt I was watching the play again.Minnie Driver as Carlotta is a scene-stealer, to say the least, and one of the best things about the film.  This was one instance in which the filmmakers got it right.But unfortunately they got one thing wrong, and that is Gerard Butler.  Although I have no complaints about Butler himself - he did a fine job, even a remarkable job in places - but he is simply too young and too handsome for the role, and while his voice is good, it is not nearly good enough.  He simply did not belong in this role.  The distorted face under the mask was disappointing too, as if the producers didn't want to mar his handsomeness by making him too scarred and ugly.  But scarred and ugly is the whole point.  The stage Phantom I saw the first time (Brad Little, who was brilliant) had an unforgettably gruesome face.  Butler's face looked like a mild case of acne in comparison, certainly not a face that would drive a person into madness and seclusion.  They missed by a long shot on that one.Nevertheless, I very much liked Butler's portrayal (it's not his fault, after all, that's he's young, handsome, and doesn't have a fantastic voice), especially during the Don Juan Triumphant scene.Overall I am very pleased with this movie, and I would highly recommend it to those who are unable to see it on stage.  Even to those who have seen it on stage, it will be a nice revisiting of great memories.\n",

            "What did you think of this movie?\n",
            "This movie is so perfect. It is a thriller/ romantic movie. The Phantom is inlove with a singer/performer named Kristine who is one of the protagonists in the movie, but her heart longs for someone else. Half of the Phantom's face is seriously disfigured, and he was hiding part of his face with a mask so that people can't see it. It is truly entertaining. I love the casts. The lovely Emmy Rossum (Kristine)possess such a powerful voice. I especially like her duet with Patrick Wilson (Rauol), who is not only handsome, but also a talented broadway singer. The plot of the movie is very interesting and the performance of the actors, especially Gerard Butler is extremely moving...... I'm glad they chose a handsome and sexy actor to play the Phantom (Gerard Butler). I have never seen the original Phantom of the Opera, but some people say that in the original rendition, the Phantom was an older man and an antithesis of the new Phantom. I think viewers might even be moved with the story. The actions committed by the Phantom are deplorable such as his murderous rampage, but you can't help but feel emphaty for the lonely soul.His pitiful experiences and his obsession with Kristine drove him into madness.  I love Gerard's performance and his eyes seem to show deep emotions; it is extremely convincing. Gerard Butler's delivery is amazing. His voice is also perfect for his role. He was able to show the mysteriousness and the passion of the Phantom with his acting skills and his voice. I never regret buying this movie. I love it!!!!!!!!!! You will like all the songs especially the song entitled \"All I Ask of You.\"\n",

            "I love the Eagles.  I listen to the Eagles Live CD all the time.  But watching this is kinda like waiting in the waiting lounge at the doctors office.  It's not every exciting, in facts it very boring and you cant wait to get the hell outta there.  OK, so the band sounds great, and all members are still at the top of their game, however its just all seems too sterile for me.  It's like watching a Fleetwood Mac concert from 2004 as apposed to 1979.  The 2004 version has the classic line up (except 1 Christine McVie) and a bazillion other musicians on stage trying desperately to re-create that studio sound.  Thats the same thing here. It's all calculated, cued, perfectly executed rock that is never outta tune, messed up or spontaneous.  While Fleetwood Mac has still retained some of their spontinuity, thanks heavily to Lindsey's atmospheric guitar jammimg,  the Eagles just Take It Easy, literally.  It's like their all  playing on auto pilot.  Yeah, that new guy on guitar, Steuart whachamacallhim is good, of course he would be, and yeah, he nails all on Don Felder's solo perfectly, but isn't that what he's suppose to do and suppose to play. I'm glad these guys are still around, especially Joe Walsh, but c'mon, I'd rather see (and hear) the Bomber (aka Joe walsh) perform solo than with the Eagles. It's more risky and exciting.  Joe Walsh is a clown in concert, and he use to be like that with the Eagles, but now he's just takes it one day at a time.  Like I first mentioned, I like the Eagles, they were exciting live when it was just the 5  guys on stage jamming, and probably under some kind of influence.  Nowadays, it's like watching a classic rock band, if you know what I mean.\n",

            "The negative reviews about crash is mostly non-sense. Crash is one of the best films produced by Hollywood in the last 10 years. I just viewed it for the second time and the movie still felt very intense. The message is simple and clear. No one can judge another human being. Everyone has good and bad. Both qualities will be shown throughout one's life. And racism is so much more than color of our skin. The movie shows that even a mother can be a racist toward her own children. I thought the film dealt with that truth very well. If a person watches this film and learns nothing or feels nothing, that is pretty sad.\n",

            "So I came to Veronica Mars late in the game, and am only half-way through season one, but I have rapidly become obsessed.  I won't repeat what the other reviews have said (except that the comparisons to Nancy Drew, Buffy, and Twin Peaks are pretty spot on).  I do want to emphasize that the show isn't perfect.  Some episodes are stronger than others, and of course the premise requires a massive suspension of disbelief, but the overall quality of the series is so far above most other TV that those seem like picky observations.  I will commit heresy though, and suggest that being dropped as a series isn't the worst thing that can happen to a good TV show.  The premise in 'Heroes' had about one good season in it, and that's what we got before it started declining.  Having said that, one or a few good seasons is more than you get in most shows.  Many of the other reviewers have name dropped their favorite shows that others may not be familiar with, so I'll do the same.  Check out 'Slings and Arrows' (18 episodes total, by design), followed by 'Book of Daniel' (only 9 episodes, that was a true loss), 'Clatterford' (12 episodes), and the live action version of 'The Tick' (but not the animated version).  If you all will try out the ones on my list you haven't seen, I promise to try out the ones on yours.\n",

            "How is the chemistry?\n",
            "I went into this movie expecting to be entertained, and I was - very much so. \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" works very well because of the amazing chemistry between the two leads, the ridiculously good-looking Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The film opens with John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) Smith in marriage counseling, and apparently, the magic has gone out of their marriage, probably because they can't speak truthfully about their jobs. They don't know that they are both skilled assassins, but when they are hired to do a hit on each other, the truth unravels. The plot is rather brainless, but I realized about ten minutes into the movie that I really didn't care.The first part of the film is more enjoyable and successful than the second part, mainly because it's fun to watch the Smiths not realize the truth about each other and then dance on eggshells around each other when they think they know the truth. The dialogue is witty, and filled with great one-liners and double entendres. Take, for example, when John and Jane return home for dinner after trying to kill each other, and John says, in response to Jane's question of why he has returned early from his so-called business trip, \"I missed you.\" She replies, matter-of-factly, \"I missed you, too.\" The movie is often very funny, although most laughs come from when they're doing generic couple stuff (like seeing a counselor, eating dinner at home, brushing their teeth, etc.).\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" relies mostly on the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie, and they have that in spades. The sex appeal literally explodes off the screen, and I wish the film spent more time laboring over the couple-stuff they do and not so much the explosions and action. Jolie has never looked better or more hypnotically beautiful than in this movie, and it's pretty obvious why Pitt's character falls for her almost instantly. I also thought that Jolie was great at making her Jane Smith character a real person; she brings a quiet poignancy to the role. As John Smith, Pitt is wickedly funny and excellent. He gets all the best lines. In the hands of a lesser actor, his lines would sometimes seem corny, but Pitt makes his character believable and extremely likable. The supporting characters (played by Adam Brody, Kerry Washington, and Vince Vaughn) seem a bit wasted, but this is, after all, the Brad and Angelina show.My main problem with the film is the excessive (and often plodding) action scenes. While it is fun to watch Pitt and Jolie look sexy while doing cool stunts, it gets tiring pretty quickly. This is the primary reason that the last thirty minutes or so of the film aren't as witty or entertaining as the earlier moments in the film. I think the movie could have been improved if there were less physical explosions and mindless action and more of the explosive chemistry in the quieter scenes between Pitt and Jolie.Despite its flaws, \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" is a wonderful way to spend two hours at the theatre. Not a movie for anyone demanding a real plot or serious depth, but worth a rental, at least. 4/5.\n",

I dont think they could have put any pther match in here but this was not getting the crowd involved to much. I liked the fact that it was fast paced and with the 7 mintues that these teams were given they did a good job. Not much to say decent. Winners and still world tag team champs Kane and the big show. Match Rating 6/10.2. Rvd vs. Rick Flair vs. Shelton vs. Finlay vs. Lashey vs. Matt Hardy money in the bank ladder match- This was a great choic by the wwe to place this second on the card. This was jsut as good as last years if not better. This was non stop action all the way through. Again i think shelton was the show stealer again when he preformed a ruuning flip off a ladder which has to be seen. Also hardy was still a nice choice to have. A nice splsh by rvd off the top of the ladder. Also a van terminator by rvd with a chair to lashey was nice. The whole match was awsome to watch. Winner Rvd. Match Rating 8.5/10.3. Jbl vs. Chris Beniot for the us title- This was a soild wrestling match but i was excepting a little more from it. I think this match needed a little more time and a better storyline but that did not make the match any worse. Not to many jbl wrest holds and i would say it was the most tecnical wrestling match on the card and soild. A good choice for the winner before the wwe squashes Jbl altogether and at least give him another title run. Winner and new wwe us champ Jbl. Match Rating 7/10.4. Edge vs. Mick Foley in a hardcore match- All i can say is wow. This was match of the night in my opinion. Also a good choice for match of the year canidate. This started out with some great intensity and it did not slow down during the rest of the match. This had everything trash cans, street signs, tables barb wire bats, thumbtacks, and tables set on fire. The only thing i wished for is if they would have given this match another 5 minutes. Edge and mick took alot of punishment and the backdrop on the tacks was sick and when edge speared mick through the buring table has to be seen to believe. Winner edge. Match Rating 10/10.5. Boogyman vs. Booker T and Sharmel- This was an awful match and was just taking up space on the card. There was a funny back stage segment before the match but that was it. Booker t could be one of the top guys fighting for the title but the wwe has everyone jobbing to someone that is going to be worth nothing in the future. Stupied decision by the wwe to even have this match. Winner the boggyman. Match Rating 2/10.6. Micky James vs. Trish for the womens title- This was another good match and proboly one of the best womens matches in the history of the wwe. This had great buldup and told an awsome story. I was so surprised by the reactioin that trish got was almost as bad as john cena. This was a back and forth match and given the time they need to have a good match. Good job by both athletes. Winner and new wwe womens champ Micky James. Match Rating 7.5/10.7. Taker vs. Mark Henry in a casket match- Was anyone expecting this to be a good match. This match was another waste of time by the wwe and a waste of a match to put taker in. Saying all that i thought this was one of mark henrys best matches ever . Yes that is how bad htis man is. It was boring but taker carried the match and a sick last ride on henry. Also a great moment were taker jumps over the casket and nails henry and a nice tombstone to close it out. Winner Undertaker. Match Rating 4.5/10.8. Hbk vs. Vince McMahon in a street fight- This was alot better than anyone expected it to be. It was good that they added the street fight rule to the match it made it alot more exciting. This also made the match better because it had a nice storyline to it. Not as brutal as the edge foley match but still up there. This had trash cans, tables, chairs, ladders, kendo sticks,belts this had it all. There is one spot that you dont want to miss in this match when michales dilavers a elbow drop off a 20 foot ladder awsome stuff. Winner Shawn Michales. Match Rating 8.5/10.9. Rey Mysterio vs. Randy Orton vs. Kurt Angle for the WHT- This was a good match except they gave this no time for it to be a good main event for samckdown. All you had to do was take the pillow fight or the booker match off the card and we could have got a soild 20 minute match maybe even more instead we get a ten minute match. Saying all that the match did not turn out bad it was jsut rushed. Lots of action the whole match and tons of near falls. The crowd was not that behind rey as i thought they would be but it was still a good match. A little bit predictable. Winner and new WHC Rey mysterio. Match Rating 8/10.10. Torrie Wilson vs. Candice in a playboy pillow fight- this was another waste of time the only good part was lokking at the girls. I think it was a good decision that they put this after the triple threat match to cool the crowd down not that exciting at all and a waste of time for the most part. Winner Torrie Wilson. Match Rating 2/10.11. John Cena vs. HHH for the WWE title- This was an awsome main event. I would have proboly gave this to the smackdown but this did not let me down. I am a big HHH fan and to cena get booed the hell out of made me so happy. I used to be a cena fan but i think he had held the title to long. The crowd was as loud as i ever remember it being sience rock vs. hogan at wrestlemania 18. This match started out slow but soon picked up and it was non stop action for the last 6 minutes of the match. Lots of near falls and alot better than alot of people thought it was going to be. Good main event. Winner and still wwe champ John Cena. Match Rating 8.5/10.Well that raps up another. i would give wrestlemania 22 a grade of 74.5/110 which is a 66% which means this was a good ppv. If they had took off the ooker and pillow fight match this would have been alot better. Why not put mnm in there. I would still get this right away when this dvd comes out. If you could tell me if my review was helpful or not. Thanks for your time.\n",

Too bad that my expectations for this flick weren't met, ... and that doesn't mean this movie is bad as in fact, it is a very good movie. The acting by Caine, Jackman and Bale is just superb, and the mood is very well captured.One thing that bothered me though was that the apparently bad guy (played by Bale) seems to be favored. When you watch this motion picture, you have to think and concentrate as in a sense from the makeup it's almost a type of Sherlock Holmes mystery although there isn't a detective in sight ... it's just a mystery with a suprising final.Now did I like this movie better than 'The Illusionist'? Can't say, although I have a tendency to favor 'The Illusionist' but I guess both films are well worth watching as both films have their surprises, excellent acting, great mood capturing with good photography.It was refreshing to see David Bowie in 'The Prestige' and too bad he hasn't been in too many films throughout his life as he's an excellent actor too.If the interest is predominantly in magic and the ultimate tricks and illusions, then most Criss Angel episodes will be more interesting and do it more justice in this regard than both of these films.

            "The Premise:The Departed is a remake of the 2002 Chinese film 'Infernal Affairs.' Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) as a young boy gets sucked into working for Boston Irish Mafia boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). When he grows up, he ends up joining the State Police under Frank Costello's direction in order to be an inside man, or a rat, for the boss. Sullivan keeps Costello tipped off, and in-turn, Costello gives Sullivan information to help him solve cases. He promotes quickly and ends up working for the State Police Special Investigations Unit (SIU) who's sole task is to bring down Frank Costello.Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is also a State Policeman, or \"Statey,\" who's troubled past brings him to the attention of Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) who heads up the undercover division of the Boston Police overseen by Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen). Dignam and Queenan are convinced that Costigan's high intelligence combined with his dubious background make him unsuitable as a traditional cop, so they offer him a job as an off-the-books, deep cover agent meant to infiltrate Costello's gang.Things get hairy when Sullivan, now working for the SIU, learns with certainty that the police have an undercover cop infiltrated into Costello's gang. The police then begin to suspect Costello has a rat inside the force. Sullivan gets yet another promotion, but this time his job is to find the rat inside the force. The problem is he is the rat. Meanwhile, Costello has another job for Sullivan: find out who the undercover cop is! Dignam and Queenan know the only way they are going to find the rat is through Costigan who's life is becoming more dangerous by the second. Which of each other Sullivan or Costigan find out first is a deadman.Thoughts:The only two real flaws I found in Infernal Affairs were the scene direction and lack of character development. I knew these were two things that Martin Scorsese was a master of, so I was very eager to see his take on the story. Exactly as I predicted, The Departed is a much deeper version of the story. You get a much stronger feel for the characters. The story definately moves slower, but you never get bored during any scenes. As well, the dialogue benefits greatly from this, and it's simply great!It's a very rare thing for such a stellar cast as featured in this film to be used so well. Most of the time when a film touts such a list of screen icons, most of them have bit roles and barely make an impact on the film. Here everyone's presence is strongly felt, and it's a wonder to behold such a cast working on such a strong film under one of the greatest film directors in history. Jack Nicholson reminds us of why he's the legend he is. Leonardo DiCaprio slams the lid on naysayers, and even Mark Wahlberg's performance is so good he blends right in with the amazing talent around him. You may even find yourself talking about his character more than any other after the film.The film is not perfect however. It does tend to feel a bit too long once you reach the third act, but not so much as to sway your overall feelings of the film. I knew and expected the film to be different from it's Chinese counterpart if simply for the fact that these are different societies and cultures we are talking about, however I didn't expect (and didn't approve of) how much The Departed would walk the lines of every idea being so black and white. In The Departed, good cops are good, and the bad cops are bad. Scorsese even makes a strong point never to show Costigan performing any truly bad deeds. Meanwhile Infernal Affairs makes a strong point to show shades of grey where neither cop was truly good and neither was truly bad. Instead, it focused on how each lived in their own hell and how it motivated their actions. The ending to Infernal Affiars was deep and thoughtful, while by comparison, The Departed feels almost cliche and very much like a \"Hollywood Ending.\"The Verdict:The Departed is easily the best crime drama since Heat. It's everything Miami Vice should have been. Martin Scorsese was born to make films like this, and this film is easily his best film since Goodfellas which coincidentally or not so coincidentally share common themes. In this film he masterfully weaves a complicated web of intrigue and deception. It may not be perfect, but damn is this one hell of a good film!\n",

            "....whether its his/her favorite Bond film or whether its his/her favorite Bond actor, there is bound to be disagreement.I will admit that this was the first Bond film I had ever seen. You're probably shaking your head at this point wondering why a self-proclaimed \"movie-buff\" hadn't seen a Bond film in her 28 years of life, but I just hadn't. I tend to avoid the big Hollywood Blockbuster movies (ie. Batman, Superman, Spiderman etc.) and am typically more into independent and/or \"artsy\" films, but I do enjoy good action/adventure as well. Not to say Bond films fall into the Hollywood Blockbuster category, however, the ones made in the last decade or so have been hyped up by Hollywood with much with so much pomp and circumstance, its actually kept me away from the theater.Regardless, I decided to \"cave in\" and rent Casino Royale when home for two weeks with pneumonia simply because I had exausted every other film in Blockbuster Video, and I was extremely surprised and impressed with the movie, so much so that I have now rented and seen most of the earlier Bond films. At this juncture, I feel I can finally submit my opinion that Daniel Craig IS the ultimate Bond! He was much more subtle than the other actors who played the coveted role, and defintiely much more manly, believeable and \"cool\" than Pierce Brosnsan who starred in the last few ones.The film was awesome (for lack of a better word): amazing special effects, quality acting, a great plot and twists and turns galore....pretty much a perfect movie (let alone a perfect \"Bond movie\").Despite being the first Bond film I've seen, its defintiely my favorite and I can't wait for Bond 22 (as yet untitled, I believe) to come out with Daniel Craig.I HIGHLY recommend owning this amazing film and adding it to your Bond collection- its worth every penny and then some!\n",

            "If you are going to introduce a new Bond, what better way to do it than go back to the beginning? This is exactly what Martin Cambell did in Daniel's Craig first movie as the beloved 007. We find a Bond at the start of his career, having recently attained the 00 status, and showing a personality that differs from what we are used to seeing from this character. I am not going to lie to you, Sean Connery still is, and probably will always be, my favorite Bond, but Craig comes pretty close to the Master. And he is undoubtedly better than the last couple of actors that attempted the feat of portraying one of the most charismatic secret agents ever.This time around, the plot takes us from Madagascar to the Bahamas. In the process we find bankers stealing money from Freedom Fighters, bomb-makers with clear and important targets in mind, a fair amount of poker playing, and of course, attractive women. The most interesting aspect of the movie is the differences in Bond's personality compared to the other movies. Here we can see how his attitude towards women changed and the reasons behind this. Also, there are many details that if you have watched the previous Bond productions you will not see in this one. Even though one of these shows up towards the end, you will miss several Bond traits that are always present. It is fun to go through the movie spotting these absences.The action scenes are exciting and even though they are unrealistic, as is usually the case with Bond movies, this aspect was toned down from the latest efforts. The high speed chase on foot in Madagascar is remarkable and very well filmed, and even though it runs for a fair amount of time, we do not get bored in the least. As I already mentioned, there is also quite a bit of poker playing. This is only natural, seeing the popularity this game has gained lately. The good news is that they managed to keep these scenes interesting and they fit well with the rest of the plot.Just when I was ready to accept that there will never be a James Bond that will make me want to see these movies again, I was pleasantly surprised by Craig. I am looking forward to his next effort and hope that we get many more at this level.\n",

            "Usually I try not to find or relate myself to movies, but this one was very touching. \"The Pursuit Of Happyness\" (ironically \"Happiness\" is mispelled just like in the movie...but the \"F\" word was spelled correctly) was an awesome movie to watch. Basically it's about a family who is struggling to get by and accumulated so much debt (parking tickets, fines, taxes, etc.) that they have no where to turn. The father (Will Smith), who sells bone density scanners for a living while the mother (Thandie Newton) works double shifts all in order to pay rent and daycare for their son (played by Jayden Christopher Smith). Eventually they come to some rough times and the mother bails out on the family, leaving the father and son moving from place to place for a place to sleep. I really don't want to give away the movie like some reviewers have. At times, this movie can be very depressing, such as the part where the father and son sleep in the bathroom of a train station. Watching this movie right here, I've learned that life can easily be much worse than it already is, and hopefully I never have to end up on the streets and sleep in public bathrooms. Then ending of the movie is worthwile though. There were some funny parts in the movie though (like the time Chris Gardner ran from the cab without paying fare). You reall have to check this movie out, because it is so inspirational about life. Also I believe lil' Jayden Smith has a promising acting career ahead of him, judging by the way he played his part in the movie. Highly Recommended.\n",

            "What happens to the husband in the story?\n",
            "'Premonition' is a suspense film that scores a little low on the suspense-o-meter.  Linda Hanson (the fabulously talented Sandra Bullock) and her husband Jim (Julian McMahon from Nip/Tuck) have a happy life.  Nice home, two beautiful daughters, and a loving marriage.  Then Jim dies in a car accident, leaving Linda trying to cope with her loss.But, when she wakes up the next morning, Jim is alive again, just like his death never happened.  But Linda remembers everything from the day before.  The film leaves you wondering which side of Linda's life is the real side, the one where she wakes up and Jim is alive, or the one where she wakes up and he's dead.  Small occurrences happen that tie the two realities together, such as a prescription from a psychiatrist and an accident with her oldest daughter.The suspense of the movie never reaches a gut wrenching level, and the soundtrack became annoying at times with its consistent \"doom-and-gloom\" sounds.  It seems as if there's a message hidden that some things are in our control, and some things are not.  The ending was a little too clich&eacute;d for my tastes.Overall, the movie just didn't quite live up to its promises, but the performances by Sandra Bullock and Julian McMahon are exceptional, carrying the weaker direction of the film.  It's not a bad movie, just not a great movie.  Rent before you buy.  Enjoy!\n",

            "I loved this movie for reasons that sometimes had little to do with the film.  I grew up on the Beatles (and the Stones, of course), in New York, worried about the Draft, protesting Vietnam, shocking total strangers by long hair and wild clothes, etc. and so it felt like a lost, overlong letter from a good friend who's a bit tired while writing and rambles on: stirring, intimate, but sometimes dull.  There are scenes of wonderful, wild inventiveness, and there are also scenes that are sadly literal and prosaic, and one that is a horrendous dud: Eddie Izzard singing \"Mr. Kite\" as if determined to trash the song.  Except for him,  the voices are all good and touching, especially that of \"Sadie\" who's a Janis Joplin figure, and the lead, who sounds eerily like Ewan McGregor in Moulin Rouge.  That comparison undercuts the movie's strengths because Julie Taymor never matches the anarchic, sensual brilliance and excitement of Moulin Rouge, where the songs burst forth from the drama. Here, you feel at times as if the songs are being plugged in mechanically to a not very inventive script.  Even the movie version of Hair had more oomph.  And yet, there's such blissful sweetness at times in Across the Universe that I felt very forgiving, and I'm still musing about the lovely gentle, transcendent treatment of \"Dear Prudence.\"  That almost makes up for the flat, unexciting finale which feels like the writers ran out of juice, and the often thin, uninspiring arrangements of the songs.\n",

The film starts out interesting enough, but soon turns into a ridiculous and amateurish horror movie with no real tension. 30 days fly by 7 to 9 days at a time with so many people getting killed in the first few minutes it should have only taken half a day to kill everybody in town. It doesn't feel like these people have been trapped anywhere for more than a few minutes! OK, they added facial hair to the men to imply some time had passed, but the time element and isolation were completely forgot about. This was really a missed opportunity as this could have been a really intense film! It turn out to be a pretty mediocre film with one of the stupidest endings I've ever seen in a horror film!

The cast includes Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr., Jack Black, Nick Nolte, and Tom Cruise. They all bring their particular talents to this movie, without which this would be a pile of bat guano. I was surpised no Private Gomer Pyle and Sergeant Carter showed up. When a group of actors is dropped into a real war zone somewhere around Cambodia after their director can't get them to cooperate, things get dangerous and interesting. A new side of the actors is seen, and not necessarily a better side on all cases. Jack Black's character wants to jump into the Heroine in the camp where they must rescue their technical advisor, FX man, and a fellow actor. Good quality DVD with a few extras. Lots of cursing, so not recommended for anyone offended by it. If you enjoyed this catch \"Scary Movie\".CA Luster\n",

            "I was so hoping to be able to give this outing of the Marvel universe five stars, but I'm afraid I just can't. Not that there is anything wrong with the actual film. Far from it. But by its very nature, it has insurmountable obstacles which would automatically deminish its potential, despite anything anyone might do with it.For one thing, if you ever were a fan of the Marvel comic books, you know that this time out you are seeing is a once-a-year annual edition, rather than a regular story. In any regular issue the story would focus on one particular plot or threat or through-line and the struggle to overcome that single problem allowed the characters to explore various aspects of their lives and personalities. In the Annual issue, the entire idea was to cram it as full of \"neat stuff\" as possible, rather than tell a linear story. It was in the annual's that such fan questions as \"if Hulk met Thor, who would win?\" got addressed, not as some necessary part of the main plotline, but just for fun. And that's what goes on here... the fun.Basically it's an almost three hour long fireworks show. It's amazing, thrilling, even mind-blowing. But after a while, fireworks, no matter how individually impressive, are still just fireworks. A couple hours into the show, you're going to experience shell shock and your ability to react emotionally is going to shut down. That's what happens in Avengers. You just never get all that emotionally involved, simply because there's so much going on, so much action, so many complex relationships, that it's overkill. All you really do is buckle in for the numerous action sequences, and those are absolute gold.I found two other flaws with the film, however.From time to time, it didn't seem to be able to decide if it wanted to be taken seriously, to make the crises genuinely moving, or it just wanted to be a wacky cartoon. Joss (as writer/director) makes a couple of poor choices with moments that could have helped pull the audience in emotionally, totally sabotaguing them. One example is late in the film where Hulk and Thor are banging away at each other, then join together to take on a massive alien flying worm creature, succeeding in killing it. But at the moment where it crashes to the ground and dies, leaving the two heroes atop its body in triumph, Joss chose to throw in a sight gag (Hulk punching Thor sideways) that is clearly out of a Warner Brothers cartoon. So a moment where we might have seen a bit of some kind of bonding between these battling characters is totally shattered in favor of a cheap, quick laugh. There are a number of those moments throughout the film that slap against any possibility of trying to take things emotionally seriously.The other weakness is the early sniping the heroes do at each other. Although it is intended to show that they are loners, egocentric and unable to bond into a cohesive unit, the dialogue is actually so witty, clever and engaging, that it all comes off like a group of friends playing \"the Dozens\" (that game where you hurl insults at one another.) There is no sense that these guys can't get along, or that there is any dangerous tension between them. It reads a lot more like Bing Crosby/Bob Hope banter in one of their Road pictures. Not that it's bad in any way. It's brilliant dialogue, heaps of fun to watch. But supposedly one of the main dramatic themes is the very \"loner\" nature of these characters and their inability to work together. At no time do you get a sense that, if one of them pushes a single inch further all hell is going to break loose, and that is what is needed to drive home the point... the Avengers were rejected by the Powers That Be because they can't work together effectively. Even a very few moments where those confrontations really looked like things were going to break into violence due to egos or annoyance would have adequetly reinforced that necessary sense that the Avengers are not going to work as a team, but no such moments exist because Joss's writing is just too darn good and engaging.Other than those few weaknesses, more a product of the very basic nature and sheer size of the piece, the Avengers is a high concept romp through a theme park of thrills. Since I first saw it three days ago, I've watched it four times, always finding tiny little additional nuggets to enjoy each time. This is one to buy and keep in the DVD jukebox rotation.One final comment. If Joss set out to make every guy in the audience fall hopelessly in love with Gweneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts, he succeeded. The by-play between her and Stark when Agent Coulson comes by is absolute bliss. I want one for Christmas.\n",

We watched it on a 55\" LG with passive 3D. The image was crisp and the 3D added, in my opinion, to the viewing experience over watching a standard Blu ray ... and I think that standard Blu rays normally look pretty good.I doubt I have to fill anyone in about the subject of this movie. It takes several Marvel super-heroes who have all had their own films leading up to this and puts them in one epic package. True to the Marvel taste, for most of the film they do not get along well with each other, but come together when it counts to fight an exhausting and dangerous battle against seemingly impossible odds. But what else are super-heroes supposed to do? LOLThe acting is convincing, and there are quite a few moments of humor to give you a break from the more serious tone of the movie (a defect in the otherwise brilliant movies in the new Batman series).The sound in this presentation is simply outstanding. I don't remember another film which has driven my subwoofer more powerfully or effectively. The rest of the sound comes through powerfully and crisply too.

The actors did the best they could with the muddle of a script and the bad directing from Guy--if the story gets boring, throw in a fight and some property damage--Ritchie (whose films I used to enjoy). And the dialogue was unintelligible at several points in the film. If I can understand Monty Python, I can understand any British accent. It wasn't the accents, it was the mumbling of the actors and the pacing of the story. Maybe Ritchie figured he could make the story more exciting (good luck) by speeding up the dialogue.

            "Although Quantum of Solace starts where Casino Royale left off, this Bond film does not hold its own with the earlier movie.  Daniel Craig is back as Bond, and if it weren't for him and Judi Dench as M, this movie would have been a complete waste.In this film, Bond is out of control and angry because of what happened in Casino Royale.  M is deeply worried about his behavior and whether she can trust him as an agent.  As Bond pursues the connections behind an assassination attempt on M, he uncovers Dominic Greene, a weaselly entrepreneur who seems on the surface to be a protector of the environment when, really, he has more devious plans.  The violence here seems too set up, as though the screenwriters wanted to dispense entirely with real plot and instead string together some really cool explosions and chase scenes.  Let's fact it:  those action scenes are only exciting when you care about what is happening.  Or you can tell what's happening.  If Casino Royale lost focus for ten minutes or so near the end, this one has hardly any focus at all.  It seems as though it ended several times over.That's not to say that the film is terrible.  Lackluster would be a better word.  Bond aficionados should see it just to complete the viewing experience, especially since the current rights holders seem determined to build more of a Bond history, one film after the next.

            "With it rapidly approaching 4,000 reviews, I'm not going to rehash the plot of AVATAR, which has literally been seen by billions.  This is (was?) a groundbreaking film when released in 2009; and although the plot is unoriginal and predictable, the process and technology creating another world, Pandora, populated by the Na'Vi, 10-foot tall, blue-skinned natives--all the product of motion capture technology by the various actors portraying the humanoids--are stunning.  I've seen AVATAR on cable several times, and while I'm not enough of a fan of the film to purchase this 3-disc extended collector's edition, I do give kudos to James Cameron and his very talented team of filmmakers; these pros have successfully created a very believable world inhabited by very believable natives and wildlife.  This film is a stunning visual feast.And this doesn't even consider the minutiae--like creating a whole new language, for goodness' sake.  Again, I am in total awe of the process involved bringing AVATAR to life; no telling how many countless hours were involved, on the part of thousands of people, during production and post-production, to make this film a reality.  Finally, although leads Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana give solid performances, I really enjoyed the second tier of the cast, including the sizzling Michelle Rodriguez (Trudy), the menacing Stephen Lang (Colonel Miles Quaritch), Joel David Moore (Norm), Dileep Rao (Max), Giovanni Ribisi (Parker, in charge of running the mining operation laying waste to Pandora; he's a scoundrel, but you can't help but like him), the incredible Wes Studi (Eytukan), and Laz Alonso (Tsu'tey).  These actors fill in the various gaps quite nicely.  No, I'm not endorsing buying this collector's edition--but I highly recommend, if you're one of the ten people who haven't seen AVATAR, to watch this incredible film.

            "Acclaimed filmmaker James Cameron once again made cinematic history with the breathtaking science fiction blockbuster Avatar. In the distant future, a handicapped ex-Marine named Jake Scully (Sam Worthington) accepts a job to aid a human colony in their mining venture in the jungle planet of Pandora where its inhabitants known as the Na'vi are strongly against the destruction to their home. Using an alien hybrid called an avatar, he makes contact with the Na'vi and becomes torn between following his orders and protecting the world he feels is his home. Avatar is an extraordinary and visually groundbreaking film spectacle that ranks as one of the most imaginative Sci-Fi movies in cinema history. Thought the story may be a somewhat clich&eacute;d with obvious stereotypes, the film is nevertheless entertaining and embracing. Cameron and his technical crew have spent many years developing the technology to create this Sci-Fi world and its inhabitants. Avatar represents an impressive leap in special effects and 3D technology. The cast also stars Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, Giovanni Ribisi and Sigourney Weaver.Avatar Extended Collection Edition is truly a must-have for Sci-Fi fans and home video enthusiasts. The award-winning blockbuster is presented in 1.78:1 widescreen format. The 3-disc Blu-ray includes the original theatrical version, the special edition re-release and the 3-hour extended cut. The picture quality is certainly reference quality with such eye-popping detail and vivid colors. The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio delivers a first rate home theater experience. The Extended Collection Edition also includes over 45 minutes of deleted scenes, the in-depth documentary Capturing Avatar, 17 behind-the scenes featurettes that further explores the film's production, screen testes, high definition picture galleries and theatrical trailers. Overall, Avatar Extended Collection Edition scores an \"A\".\n",

            "Why is the movie soo confusing?\n",
            "Inception is an interesting movie but might not be everyone's cup of tea.  Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a man who specializes in dream extractions (think corporate espionage) - going into a shared dream state using a military derived technique with a team and a subject to extract a piece of information from that subject's subconscious mind.  This can sometimes involve going into a dream within a dream (or more).Much was made of the complexities of this movie and indeed it is complex but for a generation growing up watching Matrix movies (especially the latter two) this is positively straight forward - and that's not a bad thing.  This is helped by Cobb's new dream architect (played by Ellen Page) who is also new to this world and to whom he explains the rules of the dream world (and thereby us - something not as well done in the Matrix flicks).  In addition to these dream rules there are the complexities of Cobb himself and the guilt he feels over the tragedy of his wife and kids and how this affects his missions.  And the complexities of the new job - to plant an idea into the mind (this process is called inception) of a young business tycoon who has a strained relationship with his dying father.  So yes it is complex but at no time did I feel lost either and this is a major plus for the movie.Some other plusses are extremely cool effects in the dream worlds, likable and believable characters whose interactions are fun to watch, effective action scenes, light comedic moments that pop up rarely but never fall flat and a satisfying emotional arc for our main character.  Truly there are many positive aspects to this movie.Some minuses are that it's a bit too long with a few dragging dialog sequences that could probably have been edited down.  This leads to the fact that it does slow down in parts such that you begin to get antsy (not that I have a short attention span but in a world where anything can happen?).  Despite the preceding two sentences I have to admit that all the dialog added to the movie in one way or another.I was a bit distracted by the fact that the dream rules - although meticulously laid out (which is appreciated) - did not always feel like the movie followed to the letter as laid forth.  (possible minor spoilers) For example the rules of time of a dream within a dream, etc. are laid forth but at times things seem to happen way too fast a layer or two in compared with what we know the rules are.  I also understand that the filmmakers wanted a realistic representation but I felt that dreams were - on the whole - rather boring.  I get that these particular dreams were tailor made but they were so orderly it was a bit disconcerting.  No chaos, no random events, unless provoked by the outside world (or only the next layer up),  just cities and buildings and people in suits.  Speaking for myself (but I'm insane) my dreams are a bit more chaotic.  Then again there were a few surprises in there and a few very cool dream fight sequences.Overall, yes, I do recommend this movie.  It's not as complicated as you may initially think but carries its own for sure.  The characters are well developed and the action carried out quite well within a well defined universe.  It is long and you may struggle with some of the rules but overall the movie is rewarding in visuals, story, overall action and emotional depts.  A solid four stars.\n",

            "In the early 20th century down in New Orleans, there lived a lovely waitress/chef named Tiana (Voiced by Anika Noni Rose) who has dreams of owning her very own restaurant that is as she keeps collecting money to make that a reality. However when a prince named Vaveen (Voiced by Bruno Campos) with his assitant Lawrence (Peter Barlette) come to town, they are invited to a special party to meet the local mayor's lovely daughter Charolette (Voiced by Jenifer Cody) with her father Big Daddy La Beouf (Voiced by John Goodman) that is until they meet up with a fiendish yet sly Vooodoo witch doctor named Dr. Facilier (Voiced by Keith David). He gives them an offer they can't refuse, unfortunately it turns the prince into a frog as he meets Tiana who remembers the old story of the Frog and the Princess who's kiss has to turn him human but it turns her into a frog. The two set off in the Lousiana swamps to meet up with a lovable jazz loving alligator named Louis (Voiced by Michael-Leon Wooley) joined with goofy firefly Ray (Voiced by Jim Cummings) as they head to Mama Odie (Voiced by Jenifer Lewis) so they can find a way to be human again and get back to New Orleans to stop Dr. Facilier's plans for the city.A very refreshing, hilarious and delightful animated comedy from Walt-Disney Pictures sets a new comeback for 2D animation is perfect for the whole family and is the best animated movie of the year besides \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\", \"Ponyo\" and \"Coraline\", although \"Up\" was very good but very overrated. The makers of \"Aladdin\" and \"Little Mermaid\" has crafted an original Disney animated masterpiece even if it's inspired by the title story as it has a New Orleans flavor and the first ever African American Disney animated heroine. The animation is just breathtaking and quality with the storytelling, the score and songs by Randy Newman are just great and it has the feel of 90's disney animated movies. The film co-stars Terrence Howard and Oprah Winfrey as other voices, this one has pure heart with crowdpleasing laughs and thrills that is a must see.This Blu-Ray offers brilliant flawless picture and sound much like you saw at the movies with great extras like deleted scenes, audio commentary, featurettes, music video, art galleries, and BD Live plus a digital copy and regular DVD.\n",

The cinematography is gorgeous, and the sets look great.  Art direction is superb, especially on the details of economic inequality.The maybe not so much points:Some of the CGI is a little transparent.  The political background is important but never explained.Practical Matters:If you are looking at reviews of this movie right now, it may be because you are wondering whether you need to see it before you see the sequel (s).  As of this writing, (Catching Fire is available for home viewing; Mockingjay is not out yet), no.  You won't be lost if you watch Catching Fire first.

            "This week I watched both this Swedish Blu-Ray and saw the just-released American remake in the theater, and I have read the first two books.I rate both versions at five stars--great films. There is 5.1 Dolby Digital in Swedish with the option of dubbed English dialog. I watched the Swedish language version with English subtitles, although the English dubbing did seem pretty good. The quality of sound and picture on the Blu-Ray is excellent.This Swedish film is closer to the book in detail and in dramatic portrayal. The scenery seemed more stark and cold, and the murders more appalling. Lizbeth's propensity for violence is better portrayed, and as the film progresses we get better insight into why Lizbeth is socially dysfunctional than in the American version. The reporter, Blomkvist, spends three months in jail in the Swedish version, but no jail time in the American version, and his humiliation is therefore all the greater.Noomi Repaces's Lizbeth is harsher than that of Rooney Mara in the American version and therefore more effective. Rooney Mara's amazing beauty inevitably softens her character in the American version even though her acting is excellent. The fate of the dead niece, Harriet, is far closer to the book in the Swedish version and has more dramatic impact.Noomi Repaces's dragon tattoo covers her back and is truly formidable. After all, the tattoo is the point of the title.There are many other gratuitous discrepancies in the American version that detract from the drama that made Larsson's book so powerful.Blomquist is portrayed as the same sharp researcher and unaware babe-magnet in both films. Michael Nyqvist and Daniel Craig both give excellent performances--true to Larsson's character--with Craig having the edge.If you are comfortable with subtitles, then this Swedish version might be your best choice, especially if you have already read the novel. If you prefer a more American style movie with well-known, somewhat better looking, Hollywood actors; especially if you have not read the book; then the American version may be your best choice. Or, as I did, watch the Swedish recording and then the American movie in the theater.\n",

Like one or two other reviewers, I fail to see how this film is allegedly a children's film - although they only comment on the fact that this film is extremely slow and boring.  But the reason I do not believe this movie is suitable for children (or adults come to that) is the (possibly subliminal) imagery in the movie.  Not only does the film have a somewhat creepy robot that looks human (transhumanism), it also comments that the world is a machine, that we are cogs in that machine and then worse of all, it shows MANY pictures of devils and Hade's satanic creatures and dead bodies.  There is also a creepy picture of the moon appearing to spy on us and also aliens on the moon that live underneath the surface, with closer inspection of these 'aliens' we are shown the half cresent flag.  There are lots of other images, too many to mention, personally I dont want my child thinking images of the Devil are acceptable and 'entertaining'.  I was truly shocked that the film industry have deliberately praised this film so that we will take our kids to go see it and then their impressionistic minds are given satanic images as if to glorify them.\n",

            "Reading the book first would definitely be my advice before viewing this movie because with the movie it seems to focus solely on racial tensions and that's honestly not what the book is about. The book is truly about treating people with respect and kindness. There's one line towards the end of the book that sums it up perfectly on page 492 of the book, \"Wasn't that the point of the book? For women to realize, We are just two people. Not that much separates us. Not nearly as much as I'd thought.\" The movie should have concentrated more on the relationships between the women instead of nearly eclipsing that with the circumstances during those times. The circumstances were more of the background of the story, it was the women's attitudes towards one another, their bond, their courage--all of that made the book what it was. The movie merely glossed over those and made the connection between the women nearly obsolete.I don't expect the writers and directors of films to please everyone with the outcome, but sometimes, like with this movie, it seems they barely even try. When movies like \"It's A Wonderful Life\" was being adapted into films, script after script was rejected and rewritten before they came up with something satisfactory. Now? It seems they accept the first one simply because it has a beginning and an end and then idiots pat them on the back. All this director did was pull a bunch of lines from the book and arranged them. Not only that, he BUTCHERED some of the secondary plots. I'll give you examples:1) Octavia Spencer WAS Minny Jackson and Jessica Chastain WAS the Miss Celia I'd pictured. They are both incredible actresses. But their parts were so limited, I felt as though their characters were cheated. The scene when Celia miscarried could have been more intense, so could her meeting with Johnny, but the thing that pissed me off the most was that I believe one of the most VITAL parts of the book were left out of the film. There was a part in the book where Minny tries to protect herself and Celia from a crazy man that came onto their property and in the end Celia is the one that ends up fending the attacker from Minny, basically saving her help's life.  It also showed their true relationship--that Celia FELT something for Minny. The part when a doctor had to be called when Celia lost her baby and was hemorrhaging badly and Minny was the one who called him was the actual proof that Minny had once saved her life. Yet, there was no such scene in the movie.2) Why bother saying that Minny even had an abusive husband in the first place if the idiot writer was just going to act like sitting at a table seeing some food gave her enough courage to leave him? Huh? Really? His point was she'd taught her white boss how to cook so somehow that translated into her taking all of her kids and leaving a man she's been with it seems for probably 20 years and put up with his crap all that time and all of a sudden it's only now sitting at a table looking at good food is going to give her the gumption to go. The sad part is, people don't even scream that this is insulting the audiences' intelligence--everybody seems to be going along with everything this movie is and not saying a thing no matter how ridiculous this film made it seem.3) Constantine's story in the movie makes little to no sense at all. There are so many vital elements left out of that story it's a shame; and the parts that the writer of the movie put in are simply an embarrassment. The movie just made Constantine's daughter look haughty and disrespectful and that's not how she should've been depicted at all. Lulabelle was Constantine's daughter's name in the book, but apparently in the screen adaption, \"Rachel\" was somehow more appropriate *shrugs* (As if Mae Mobley didn't sound like a ridiculous name? If you're going to keep a baby named Mae Mobley, why not keep Lulabelle?), but she was just as much a victim of circumstance as any of the other women and she had a reason to be angry as well. She didn't just barge into Charlotte's house for no reason at all. Charlotte's role in the movie was also changed--she was vicious and vindictive when it came to Constantine between the pages of the book and Charlotte really did do her wrong, but we get none of that in the movie.I'm glad I read the book first because I'm not sure what my reaction would've been had I seen this watered down movie version. Knowing the back story for the characters and their situations was its only saving grace for me. Was the majority of the acting terrific? Yes, it was. Was it shot beautifully? Indeed, it was. Was the script poorly written? I must say, it was.The real story, the one you find between the pages of the book in which this movie was based on, is ugly and powerful and wonderful all at the same time. It'll make you laugh and cry--and this is coming from someone who didn't even want to read the book at first. The book is about women and their friendships with one another, women and their relationships with their children, women and their relationships with the help they have in their household, women and their relationships with themselves. Race comes secondary when it comes to the real story found in the book. The movie was more flashy than anything with Lafayette from True Blood (don't get me wrong, I love Nelsan Ellis, and he's amazingly talented, but it's almost gimmicky to have certain actors in films nowadays and his part kind of felt that way even though he was flawless). Also the character given to Leslie Jordan (known for his role on Will and Grace as Beverley Leslie) came off that way as well--gimmicky (esp with the cartwheel he did at the Benefit, I believe it was). That character was meant to be a chunky hard around the edges kinda guy, but he was funny.Most people are screaming that this movie is sooooo great, and it really isn't. It's mediocre at best. The book is truly wonderful.\n",

            "It has a few moments. As the New Yorker said (roughly), it's sounds good when described, but it does not work well, a lot of funny ideas wasted. Kevin Spacey steals every scene he is in, but he's just being the same mean guy he often is. I've now come to realize why Jason Bateman did not make it after Teen Wolf 2: he only has one character in him and he does it in every movie. Poor guy has not made a great movie yet. He works as the central character in Arrested Development because of the enormous talent surrounding him and the great writing. The guy from IASIP is just annoying. Anniston's character does not exist in real life, she is purely wish fulfillment. The three central men are portrayed as smart guys and then we are supposed to believe that all three of them will mess up their caper at every chance. They do nothing right, very predictably. Colin Farrell is fun, but only because it's him, like Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder. Steve Buscemi would have been better in both roles, but we would have just believed him and not thought it funny to have a Hollywood heart-throb play a douchebag. Is it funny to see a \"stud\" play a prick with a comb-over? Maybe for the first five seconds. The best moments are played by Jamie Foxx, as well as the way too short appearance by the guy from the Fantastic Four. Overall, the plot is obvious, the comedy is clunky, we don't get to know any of the characters at all (well, maybe Kevin Spacey's the most).\n",

What a great idea, A guy related to the Grimm brothers has the sight and can see into the world of the supernatural and fights supernatural crime.  The only problem is that every episode is a bad clich&eacute;.  Lizard men eat rat people,  A pied piper dude controls rats that kill, etc.  Also everyone is white save the partner and one cop.  This would be fine if all the monsters were not white people.  This show takes place in Portland Oregon so you think there would be lots of run ins with Native American fey folk and monsters but no, not a one.  There are run ins with Wendigo but they are white people like every other supernatural clich&eacute; creature.I was kinda hoping for a Norwegian troll that runs a Kung Fu school helping them the gang to find a murder who is just a murderer of humans.  Maybe a tater that was taken from a circus but the tiger is actually a Chinese dude who stayed in tiger form so he would not get caught. America is so rich with people and cultures I'm surprised that this show resorts to making up stuff like beaver man and does not use any of the ethic groups actually living in Portland.I like the premise of the show, the actors and the characters but I feel they are trapped in a loop.  There were points when I felt the show could have gotten interesting but chose not to like (spoiler) when the blonde witch lady goes to seduce the partner.  If she actually liked the partner then you would get conflict and romance but it did not happen.  Our hero's romance is really boring and would be better if she was bitten by a werewolf or something but the best the show does is giving here amnesia which is so boring. The mom discovers our hero hanging out with two were people and says racist stuff and no one calls her a racist.  The list goes on.More complaints: (spoiler) Our hero's werewolf friend says he ate people but he never asks about that. He just hangs out with a people eater I guess.  His mom may have killed many harmless were creatures but he never asked her about that or about abandoning him.  It's ridiculous. I'm giving the show two stars but it is mostly for the idea and the actors.\n",

            "I went in to  \"John Carter\" filled with trepidation.  I often avoid these big, splashy CGI spectacles that never live up to their promises and I was sure that this film was going to be nothing more than lots of cinematic eye candy and short on substance. Added to that there was a lot of lackluster critical reviews.  Well, all I can say is that this was a grand entertainment and I am so glad I caught it on the big screen!I've heard some critics say the plot was a mess and overly convoluted. Really?  My suggestion to them is \"don't text while watching a movie, you might miss something\".  I found the plot fairly well done and actually made sense (if only the last Star Trek film had that going for it) and was interesting to boot.I also read that the look of Barsoom (Mars to you and me) was dull and uninteresting.  Hmmm, never been an admirerer of the stark and raw beauty of the American southwest I guess.  Personally I found Barsoom to be beautiful, alien, exotic and familiar all at the same time. After all, the Mars rovers have confirmed that the Red Planet does indeed look like our American southwest and I for one happen to think both places very scenic.Some critics have said the story is dull and lifeless.  OK, put down the crack pipe and step away from the video game console.  \"John Carter\" has a great fast paced plot with lots of interesting twists and turns. I also thought the characters were nicely drawn, if not overly complex, and that the alien races on Barsoom to be very interesting with fascinating customs which only made me want to learn more about them.Other critics have complained that they have seen this stuff before in movies like Star Wars and Avatar.  Wellllll, it seems as though those two directors (among other film makers and writers) have been looting the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs for quite some time so I guess there is bound to be a feeling of deja vu.Have we really become such a culture that is so easily jaded?  Can we no longer feel that sense of wonder and feeling of adventure in a film like \"John Carter\"?  Maybe we are too use to storylines being spoon fed to us in easily digested bites and cannot follow along with a film that isn't zipping past our eyeballs at 186,000 miles per second with flashy explosions at every eye blink.  If true then how sad that such a wondrous film will get pushed to the wayside in favor of something like Transformers 8.\n",

            "I went into this film having never read the books, though I knew something about the world. I did for example know what a Thark was going in. And having seen it I have to pay this film the highest compliment I can give: I want to read the books. I fear that a sequel will never be made, and while the film doesn't end on a cliffhanger per se it does feel rather like the ending of the Fellowship of the Ring. And that is sad because of all the movies out there getting sequels at the moment I can think of no world I'd rather go back to than this one.The world is the main selling point of this film. Mars (or Barsoom) is an ancient world, dry and dying. It is filled with beautiful red deserts (which I feel could have been a little more red but still...) and strange peoples. The strangest are probably the Tharks: nine-foot tall green aliens with big tusks and anger issues. They are led by Tars Tarkas, an excellent Willem Dafoe who apparently acted out the part on stilts. The Tharks are what the Na'vi should have been. They may have some of the characteristics of the 'noble savage' but they are also violent and not particularly friendly to outsiders. In other words they have the capacity to be noble but they can also be a genuine threat.If I occasionally compare this film to Avatar or other films it is an unfortunate necessity. Many science fiction epics have stolen much from John Carter. This has led to many complaints of 'having seen it before' and 'it's ripping off other, better films.' Many of these critics don't realize that John Carter is the work that has been ripped off, not vice versa, and even for those who do it doesn't matter. They are film critics after all, not literary ones. The most obvious case of the movie 'ripping off' a 'better' movie is in the arena sequence. This looks exactly like the sequence from the end of Attack of the Clones. Even though it is done better and makes more sense here, I can't deny that it looks like a blatant rip off to those not in the know. But on the whole I was surprised how new and fresh it appears. The ships and costumes are amazing. They used an admirable amount of restraint in making them feel used and lived in. The motorbike-type ships offer the best example of this. The wings fold up and pop out only when in use. In every film I've seen for the last fifteen years the action of opening/closing the sails would be a big complicated affair to show off how cool the technology is. Here it simply pops open. It feels like a real piece of technology that one might use rather than a cheap gimmick. As to the costumes, they are uniformly excellent. They feel lived in, and if they are slightly campy they never go overboard.I'd call the story fairly basic, although there is much detail given along the way. There is an evil general called Sab Than who wants to take over Mars and so he wishes to marry princess Deja Thoris of his rival city. Pretty standard stuff, and he seems a thoughtless brute right out of Flash Gordon or some other adventure serial. Where things get interesting is in the people controlling him. For he is not the film's main villain, merely their puppet. The true villains of the piece are the Tharns, a race of immortals who can disguise their appearance at will and who feed off the destruction of worlds. They've given great power to Than since he seems most likely to achieve this end. He's a good choice too since he causes such a big commotion that people don't think to look beyond him for even darker motives. The really nice thing about the Tharns is that they aren't really brute force villains. They don't destroy the planets, they simply arrange for the inhabitants to do so. They are a quite genuine threat, and when they're done with Mars their next stop is Earth. I don't understand why that little fact has been left out of the trailers.It is through the Tharns that John Carter ends up on Mars. They have the ability to transport themselves between worlds and Carter ends up on Mars by accident after killing one. Here we get one of the film's few missteps. The scenes on Earth take up about twenty minutes and are not particularly engaging, despite Bryan Cranston as a Union officer trying to recruit Carter into the army for some undeveloped reason. Oh yeah, it's 1868 and John Carter is a Confederate veteran from Virginia. Kinda important to know that. Fortunately, once he gets to Mars there is rather more life in the film. John finds that he is insanely strong and has the ability to jump really high due to the lower gravity on Mars. Once there he ends up stuck in one bad situation after another as he acclimates himself to the world. Naturally it's not long before he runs into princess Deja who is fleeing her forced wedding.Character-wise Deja is the real standout. Many people have compared her to princess Leia, but while this comparison is not without merit she is very much her own character. She manages to come off as tough and noble without it feeling forced. I often find female action heroes to be lacking a certain credibility that the guys acquire more easily, yet in this case I found the girl more believable a fighter than the guy. Partly it comes down to the inconsistency of his superpoweredness, but there is also the fact that Taylor Kitsch just isn't a very good actor. He certainly doesn't ruin the film, but he doesn't particularly impress either. That's probably a good part of why the Earth scenes felt flat. They could have really used a better leading man in this role. Fortunately the supporting cast more than make up for it. As with most epic films of this sort the lead character is a somewhat blank slate simply to provide a focus of normality in the crazy world. I've mentioned most of the supporting cast already, but especial props must go out to Mark Strong and Willem Dafoe. Mark Strong is the lead Thern, and for a character who never emotes or acts even remotely menacing he manages to be quietly terrifying. But in some ways he has it easy since he is in an comparatively uncumbersome costume. Willem Dafoe was acting on stilts in the middle of the Arizona desert knowing all the while that he would be digitally replaced in post-production, yet his Tars truly feels like a living character. The other actors do their part well and while there is a fair amount of overacting there are no really bad performances here. Even Kitsch manages to be decent if unimpressive.The rest of the production is similarly first-rate. Effects, scripting, editing - all top class. The musical score is very nice, though they do tend to repeat just one theme instead of creating several. The action scenes have been criticized as sub-standard, but I don't see it. For me the key mark of a good action scene is that I actually care what happens in it. On that mark they certainly succeed. If they could have used more inventive plotting, well that's a fairly minor flaw. A more substantial problem which critics can't seem to get over is the nature of the world. People are flying around in airships powered by light, yet they're still fighting with swords. This is one of those things you can just either accept or not. I have no problem with suspending my disbelief, but I get that others can't. To which I simply have this to say: this movie isn't for you. This film is likely to have a fairly narrow audience, although I imagine it would be popular with the majority of kids. Those who can appreciate this kind of thing, and can ignore that it's set on Mars, are likely to find that it is amazingly good fun.I'm rather amazed that this film got made at all. it is not the sort of movie studio execs like to see. Aliens, a campy story (on Mars no less), and a rather eccentric group of characters, all with no big star. It's amazing it ever got funded. People seem uninterested in seeing it, which is very unfortunate as this is a film which deserves to succeed. I want to see more of the marvelous world of Barsoom and the further adventures of John Carter. But Disney seems uncertain of how to market this, as evidenced by the removal of the iconic \"From Mars\" from after John Carter's name. This is a film which you will either love or not. And there's nothing wrong with that. Some people love sushi, but I can't stand it. That doesn't mean that sushi is bad and everything I like good. The simplest way to figure out whether you will like this film is to ask yourself whether the idea of swordfights in airships and green aliens on Mars appeals to you. If it does then the odds are that you'll like this movie. If you're not sure, give it a shot. you may be surprised. But if that just sounds silly and ridiculous then avoid this movie. It is exactly what it appears to be: a scifi action-adventure with aliens, flying ships, and sword-fights.\n",

What they are and what their intentions seem to be, are partially, explained. By the end of the film, there are still many questions to be answered. Its obvious there is more to be told and revealed in another film.If you're hoping to see facehuggers, chestbursters and xenomorphs (full-grown Aliens), well, you do get to see some creatures, but none of them are recognizable. In fact, these creatures seem to be early versions of the Aliens or the original creatures that the Aliens came from. These creatures have elements of the Aliens and are no doubt, related.I don't want to give away the plot, but know the planet and the Jockeys are not the same that are seen in Alien. This is a different planet and these Jockey ships aren't carrying eggs.Now, people who have seen the film say it lacks character development and the film is overall, disappointing. I agree that the film is a little slow and doesn't have a lot of action, but the action scenes, including a self-surgical procedure scene, are intense.The cinematography and visual effects are stunning, as well as designs and sets. The production is just fantastic.The acting is well done, especially, by Michael Fassbender as \"David\", Noomi Rapace as \"Elizabeth Shaw\", and Charlie Theron as \"Meredith Vickers\".The story/script is kind of frustrating to follow, due to many questions it proposes, but I thought the pacing was ok. It felt like it was quicker than Alien's and that has to do with less character development scenes (which honestly, Alien was rather light on character development).I understand that people were disappointed that this was not \"Alien\" and I agree, to an extent, but that was  not the intention of Ridley and the writers, to make another Alien film. It's a prequel story that takes place at a much earlier time. There are elements of the franchise, absolutely, but this is it's own prequel story.For what is, I enjoyed it and can't wait to see the answers in the sequel.If you read other reviews that are mixed or negative, I just say don't expect \"Alien\".

            "It's been four years since Slumdog Millionaire took home eight Oscars. I found myself thinking of that movie because Life of Pi opens in India and the cast is predominantly comprised of Indian actors. Like Slumdog Millionaire, the movie uses several actors to portray the main character at different ages. In fact, the older Pi is played by Irrfan Khan, who appears in both movies.The story is framed with the older Pi relating his story to a writer. We learn that Pi's father owned a zoo, and his mother worked there as a botanist. His father is fond of giving Pi advice, and one memorable lesson involves a demonstration of how dangerous tigers can be, and that they should not be treated like a pet or a friend.Pi is shown at four different ages, but the bulk of the story shows Pi as a young man, so Suraj Sharma receives the most screen time. Like Cast Away and 127 Hours, the movie relies on one actor holding our attention, and Sharma does a wonderful job of doing just that. It's his first role and he had to show a vast range of emotions in order for everything to work.The first part of the movie shows Pi's life as a young boy. We see him go to school, and ultimately fall in love. But his life (and the story) is shaken up when his mother and father inform him that they have decided to move the family to Canada. Along with some of the animals, they set sail for their new home. If you have seen the trailer, or even the poster for this movie, it's not a spoiler to reveal that Pi ends up in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. I imagine that's quite a selling point, as a lot of people would wonder how such a relationship could possibly work.Director Ang Lee overcomes the limitations of such an enclosed setting in several spectacular ways. It's fascinating to see how Pi tries to survive, as well as co-existing with a dangerous carnivore. The visual aspects of the movie are of the highest quality, and I would be shocked if the movie wasn't nominated in several technical categories. The tiger is convincing, but the visual effects also shine when we are shown some of the things that can happen at sea.I think Life of Pi is a movie that should be experienced without knowing too much of the story beforehand, so I am not going to reveal anything more about the plot. Although I will mention that the ending is open-ended and leaves you guessing about what really happened out on the ocean.Religion is an ever-present theme. The movie will ask you to think about why the events in our lives happen, and whether they are random or part of God's plan. But more than one religion is mentioned, and it's not done in an overbearing way.The script is well-written, and is a big reason why the story works. There is quite a bit of humor, but it's smart and feels natural.I'm not sure how many movies I have seen this year, but this is one of the best. The story feels fresh and unusual, and some of it is profound and moving. I should also say that a few of the animals are hurt or even killed, so be warned if you are sensitive to such things. That said, you would see more brutality on a nature documentary like Planet Earth.Life of Pi grabbed my attention early and held it for two hours. It's more than special effects, with the screenplay and acting both standing out. I highly recommend it.Overall score 4.5/5\n",

            "As a fan of Brad Pitt, I was expecting a lot more from &#34;World War Z&#34;.  The movie falls flat, with a mostly irrelevant supporting cast (especially Mireille Enos) and contrived action scenes.  I was unable to reach a &#34;willing suspension of disbelief&#34;, when watching this film.  The manner in which Brad Pitt is shown to know more about zombie behavior and global epidemiology than virtually anyone else in the entire world symbolizes the lack-luster effort that apparently went into adapting this screenplay (from what is generally regarded a very good novel). Even the zombie action sequences are mostly disappointing (except for the opening few minutes, which were done well).  Stuff just jumping out at you and making loud noises does not translate into suspense and horror.  Skip this one, in my opinion.\n",

            "I'll start with the negative. The movie was overly long and took me three attempts to get through it as it kept putting me to sleep. I would suggest fast forwarding through the whole first part - the failed wedding.Now for the positive. The movie was visually striking and once you accept it as a psychological commentary, the symbolism becomes apparent. There is a lot more to it than the basic characters. While I agree with one review which commented upon how depressed people might behave more calmly in the face of disaster, I think that review entirely missed the point of the effects of melancholia upon people other than those who suffer directly. For example, the approaching planet, Melancholia, sucked part of the atmosphere away, causing strain and lethargy in everyone. Then there was a scene in which the depressed person beat a horse in an effort to get it to cross a bridge it would not cross. I thought that the horse beating scene was carried out by the wrong character and would have been more fitting for the frustrated Keifer Sutherland when I first thought about it, but on further thought I see that the scene was meant to symbolize the melancholic's failed attempts to act only to try to please others and not break out of despair.All in all, the movie was rather interesting, which gets the three stars I gave. It has a lasting effect which might take time to sink in. If I had written the review immediately after watching, I would have given it only two stars, but the haunting effect a few days later has led me to see it in a better light.\n",

            "\"Man Of Steel\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: A young boy learns that he has extraordinary powers and is not of this Earth. As a young man, he journeys to discover where he came from and what he was sent here to do. But the hero in him must emerge if he is to save the world from annihilation and become the symbol of hope for all mankind.The cast led by Henry Cavill (as Clark Kent / Kal-El / Superman), Amy Adams (as Lois Lane), Michael Shannon (as General Zod), Kevin Costner (as Jonathan Kent), Diane Lane (as Martha Kent), Laurence Fishburne (as Perry White) & Russell Crowe (as Jor-El) is excellent. The directing by Zack Snyder is excellent. The story (based on the comic books created by Jerry Siegel & Joe Shuster) by David S. Goyer (also did the screenplay) & Christopher Nolan (who also produced), the screenplay by Goyer is excellent.The music by Hans Zimmer is excellent. The cinematography by Amir Mokri is excellent. The film editing by David Brenner is excellent. The casting by Kristy Carlson & Lora Kennedy is excellent. The production design by Alex McDowell is excellent. The art direction by Chris Farmer & Kim Sinclair is excellent. The set decoration by Anne Kuljian, set dressings by Paul Allen, Danial A.

Lee, Thomas Machan, David Moreau, Sarah Nolan, Margot Ready, Kerry Sanders & Bryan Sutton is excellent. The costume design by James Acheson & Michael Wilkinson is excellent.

The stunts coordinated by Damon Caro & fights coordinated by Ryan Watson is excellent.This is an excellent and well-done, well-made reboot of the Superman saga that is entertaining and impressive. This is also an impressive film, visually and thematically. Zack Snyder has directed an excellent film, which is possibly his best film of his career, thus far. Christopher Nolan has also done an excellent job in helping revive the Superman saga. Henry Cavill is an excellent Superman / Clark Kent / Kal-El & Amy Adams is an excellent Lois Lane, with an excellent cast backing them up. This is one of the best movies of the summer season and of the year.\n",

            "How is it the story line?\n",
            "Before anyone gets upset that I am reviewing this film before it is released in theaters, I want to let it be known I was fortunate enough to get advanced screening passes for the film. Guillermo del Toro directs two types of films, high concept art house type films usually in Spanish(Pans Labyrinth, The Devil's Backbone), and action blockbusters with high budgets and heavy use of CGI (Blade II, Hellboy, and its sequel), this film falls into the latter category, which anyone who has seen the preview can surmise. The dialogue feels canned and cheesy one-liners fly from the mouths of nearly every actor in this film. The plot is as thin and predictable as it is farfetched, but this could all have been guessed from watching the trailer as well.A few actors who weren't featured in the trailers make appearances, I won't spoil who they are or what roles they play, but they are a pleasant surprise as they provide some relief from a story that is a little too serious at times. While no one makes Oscar worthy performance, the acting is perfectly acceptable and on par with most action movies, although some of the actors are not the greatest at American English accents in spite of their efforts. I suppose this can be explained away as the film is set in the future, and who knows what American English will sound like then (I'll bet it will sound quite a lot like mine, my parents', and my grandparents' accents).While the plot, dialogue, and acting are on par with every other action blockbuster of the past decade, I must admit that the CGI and visuals are some of the most realistic I have seen. The visual effects are stunning. Thanks to the amazing work of Industrial Light and Magic there is not a single scene in the film where I felt as though the CGI was blatantly apparent beyond the fact that such things do not exist, something I wish I could say about the recently released Man of Steel. The 3d is also quite good, sometimes 3d is a little overdone and it feels unnatural and hurts your eyes, this is fortunately not the case with this film. This 3d experience is easily on par with Avatar, probably the result of a film which was intended for 3d from the get go. All in all this film is an entertaining escape, albeit one that may not be too surprising or particularly memorable.\n",

Having been too young to watch and listen to the original lone ranger series when it originally was aired, I did as a kid see them as reruns, I can see where the criticisms come from when comparing the two as this is not what I would consider the Lone Ranger as it was originally intended. With that being said, if you strictly compare the two, then yes this version will fail to live up to your expectations, especially if you grew up on the original. But if view this as something different, then this movie although not a classic, is fun and entertaining. Yes the character interaction and lines are a bit campy, the action over the top, and the movie a bit too long at times but it did keep me entertained. I did think the flashbacks (or flash forwards as they were) with the little boy at the carnival were a bit distracting from the movie and really felt out of place and kind of ruin the pacing of the film. I would almost compare this movie as a mix of Wild Wild West (which this movie is better) and Pirates of the Carribean (which this movie is not as good as). This movie has a mix of light-hearted humor, sarcasm, and some violence and tries to entertain all ages, which actually I think it is its biggest problem. It tries to go after every type of audience and sometimes gets in its own way.With all that being said, I say don't necessarily listen to the critics and go and judge this movie for yourself. If you keep an open mind and don't try to compare to the original Lone Ranger series, then you might find like I did, that this movie was entertaining and worth a watch.\n",

Unmistakably good, at that. Whereas the last couple of Pixar movies have descended to fairly typical Disney fare, Frozen rises towards the kind of film we haven't seen from Pixar since Toy Story 3 (a movie that made me cry, and I don't cry at movies very often). It's not as good as TS3, but it's definitely the best Disney Animation movie in a good long while.In an effort to avoid spoilers, I'll just say that the movie is delightful on so many levels. Olaf steals every scene he's in, and my kids loved him. Seriously, my daughter especially has not stopped talking about him, and both of the younger ones have been singing as much of his &#34;puddle&#34; song as they can remember. My daughter, who is less interested in movies than the boys, would have turned right around and seen it again.The animation in the movie was, in a word, incredible, especially the ice and especially especially the ice bridge. The songs are good (and who knew Kristen Bell could sing? Okay, so, well, maybe lots of people, but I didn't know, so I was surprised to see that she had performed her own songs), and, as I've already implied, the song by Olaf was really catchy.The best parts of the movie, however, can't be talked about without being spoilery: You've been warned.The death of the parents at the beginning of the movie is pretty typical for Disney. I'm not quite sure why all of their young heroes have to be orphans of some type, but it's almost always the case. Possibly, for Frozen, it's there to help you feel as if you're in a typical Disney film (I kind of doubt it), but, whatever the reason, you know when the parents are leaving on their trip that they're not coming back. Of course, that's what sets up the problems for the rest of the movie. Elsa has no one to help her cope with her powers and grows up in isolation because of it.One of the best moments is between Anna and Kristoff as he chastises her for attempting to marry someone (Hans) that she had just met that day. It's very amusing, because the immediate True Love thing is so endemic in Disney movies, so it's refreshing to see it handled like this in this movie. In fact, the catalyst of the whole thing is Elsa (now the Queen) refusing to allow the marriage between Anna and Hans because they had only just met. There's even a comment from Kristoff to Anna where he is saying &#34;no&#34; to her about something (no, I don't remember exactly what) because he doesn't trust her judgement. All of this is a nice break from that Disney cliche.And then there's the whole thing with True Love's Kiss that they also turn on its head, and that was great to see, too. And I won't say more than that, because I don't want to give everything away. Let's just say that the movie ended with both Anna and Elsa growing as characters, something that Brave, unfortunately, lacked.At any rate, it's a very enjoyable movie and one that I hope is signaling a new direction for Disney. Disney Princesses are great and all that, but it's good to have some that don't need to get rescued.Also, Alan Tudyk was great. I didn't even realize that was him until I saw his name in the credits. He's a great voice actor and under-appreciated as an actor in general.\n",

            "Context:  Well, I have to admit I wasn't expecting to like this movie, having read all the bad press surrounding it.  But I saw it last night on a whim and I have to say I thought it was fantastic!  Firstly, as a movie it is incredibly well shot.  The scenery is wonderful and the sets are painstakingly recreated - never once do you doubt this is 1st century Palestine.The acting starts off a little strained in the garden scene, when the movie is just finding it's feet (and the audience is coming to terms with the fact that the movie isn't some horrible, cheap propaganda short, but a proper movie) but quickly becomes impressive and ends up brutally real.Gibson has set out to make a compelling dramatization of the last 12 hours of Jesus' life as described in the Gospels and that's pretty much what he does.  There is certain artistic license taken and some good abstract movie-making, but nothing that really detracts from the movie or the sentiment.  In fact the scenes where they have the Billy Corgan/ Marylin Manson devil figure floating around are amongst the strongest scenes in the movie (Especially the gratuitously freakish defomed child at the whipping! What was that about?!).  The movie is shocking, and at times painful to watch.  I think the movie only strays into questionably graphic violence occasionally, most notable when Christ's hands are nailed to the cross and we see blood squirting up onto the Roman soldier's smirking face.  That's a touch over the top for my taste.Being an UWS-dwelling New Yorker, I had the anti-Semitic accusations in the back of my mind for the whole movie, and I have to say I found nothing that could possibly be construed as anti-Semitic.  Instead the movie shows a nuanced and balanced set of Jewish characters who run the gamut of emotions from hating Jesus to loving him from falsely accusing him to insisting on a fair trial.  To read some press reviews I'd assumed the movie was full of big-nosed demons laughing maniacally in shadowy corners - that impression is patently absurd, in fact even Jesus' Pharisee accusers are sickened by his whipping and turn away in anguish and perhaps contrition.  If anything it is the Romans who 2000 years later are amongst Catholicism's staunchest supporters, that revel in the torture and mockery of Christ.  But hey, it's all there in the gospels.I think this is a pretty \"Catholic\" film.  Historically the Catholic faith has always revered the human side of Jesus more strongly.  They worship him for his suffering on our behalf his death for our sins, and yes his long, drawn out death.  Speaking from the Protestant tradition I'd prefer to see a movie that celebrated Jesus' life and teachings more than his suffering, and perhaps brought out the good news of his resurrection more than this movie, but hey, Mel has another 33 years of material to work with should he choose to make a sequel or a prequel.I'm not sure that this movie will make many converts - it's a compelling and powerful piece of art, but any theology is brief and death related - flashbacks to scenes in Jesus' earlier ministry deal with specific death prophesies (\"This is my Body, broken for you...\" etc) or somewhat heavy-handed juxtapositions of his teaching vs his treatment (\"Love thy neighbour, and love thine enemy likewise.\").  I'm not sure that this condensed and selective teaching will convert anyone up front, but it's already made me reread a few of the gospels.Anyway, I think it's a movie everyone should see to make up their own mind about - personally I can't wait for the DVD release so I can watch it without subtitles, as Gibson originally intended. That'd be even more brutal...\n",

              " 'context': 'Well, I have to admit I wasn\\'t expecting to like this movie, having read all the bad press surrounding it.  But I saw it last night on a whim and I have to say I thought it was fantastic!  Firstly, as a movie it is incredibly well shot.  The scenery is wonderful and the sets are painstakingly recreated - never once do you doubt this is 1st century Palestine.The acting starts off a little strained in the garden scene, when the movie is just finding it\\'s feet (and the audience is coming to terms with the fact that the movie isn\\'t some horrible, cheap propaganda short, but a proper movie) but quickly becomes impressive and ends up brutally real.Gibson has set out to make a compelling dramatization of the last 12 hours of Jesus\\' life as described in the Gospels and that\\'s pretty much what he does.  There is certain artistic license taken and some good abstract movie-making, but nothing that really detracts from the movie or the sentiment.  In fact the scenes where they have the Billy Corgan/ Marylin Manson devil figure floating around are amongst the strongest scenes in the movie (Especially the gratuitously freakish defomed child at the whipping! What was that about?!).  The movie is shocking, and at times painful to watch.  I think the movie only strays into questionably graphic violence occasionally, most notable when Christ\\'s hands are nailed to the cross and we see blood squirting up onto the Roman soldier\\'s smirking face.  That\\'s a touch over the top for my taste.Being an UWS-dwelling New Yorker, I had the anti-Semitic accusations in the back of my mind for the whole movie, and I have to say I found nothing that could possibly be construed as anti-Semitic.  Instead the movie shows a nuanced and balanced set of Jewish characters who run the gamut of emotions from hating Jesus to loving him from falsely accusing him to insisting on a fair trial.  To read some press reviews I\\'d assumed the movie was full of big-nosed demons laughing maniacally in shadowy corners - that impression is patently absurd, in fact even Jesus\\' Pharisee accusers are sickened by his whipping and turn away in anguish and perhaps contrition.  If anything it is the Romans who 2000 years later are amongst Catholicism\\'s staunchest supporters, that revel in the torture and mockery of Christ.  But hey, it\\'s all there in the gospels.I think this is a pretty \"Catholic\" film.  Historically the Catholic faith has always revered the human side of Jesus more strongly.  They worship him for his suffering on our behalf his death for our sins, and yes his long, drawn out death.  Speaking from the Protestant tradition I\\'d prefer to see a movie that celebrated Jesus\\' life and teachings more than his suffering, and perhaps brought out the good news of his resurrection more than this movie, but hey, Mel has another 33 years of material to work with should he choose to make a sequel or a prequel.I\\'m not sure that this movie will make many converts - it\\'s a compelling and powerful piece of art, but any theology is brief and death related - flashbacks to scenes in Jesus\\' earlier ministry deal with specific death prophesies (\"This is my Body, broken for you...\" etc) or somewhat heavy-handed juxtapositions of his teaching vs his treatment (\"Love thy neighbour, and love thine enemy likewise.\").  I\\'m not sure that this condensed and selective teaching will convert anyone up front, but it\\'s already made me reread a few of the gospels.Anyway, I think it\\'s a movie everyone should see to make up their own mind about - personally I can\\'t wait for the DVD release so I can watch it without subtitles, as Gibson originally intended. That\\'d be even more brutal...',\n",

        "The Amazon rainforest (Portuguese: Floresta Amazônica or Amazônia; Spanish: Selva Amazónica, Amazonía or usually Amazonia; French: Forêt amazonienne; Dutch: Amazoneregenwoud), also known in English as Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle, is a moist broadleaf forest that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 square kilometres (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 square kilometres (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations. The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. States or departments in four nations contain \"Amazonas\" in their names. The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species.\"\"\"\n",
