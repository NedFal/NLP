In each section of my code, I've added comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the code. Due to the challenges of right-to-left text alignment in Persian, I've switched to English for convenience.

The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle, as mentioned in the code. Initially, I intended to crawl a dataset from Twitter, but I encountered issues with Twitter's developer section. Consequently, I explored other datasets and considered using a comprehensive collection of tweets. However, due to its large size and other associated problems, it was not feasible. Eventually, I found a dataset that includes a series of tweets from the time of the Trump debates, which is of an appropriate size and provides good validity for Sentiment Analysis. I sought assistance from various sources, one of which was Towards Data Science.

For training, I utilized a GPU for enhanced performance.
